Debug Waveform
==============

Debug Usage
-----------

**How to use the debug graph**

The debug waveform exists to provide the user the ability to implement a custom waveform on the USS library target side, then transmit it to the Design Center for graphing.

There are two reserved user HID command for this purpose, 0xB6 (only debug plot 1) and 0xB7 (debug plots 1 - 4). Documentation as to how to use this command exists in the USS Software Library User's Guide.

**Control Information**

   Debug Controls

The debug graph provides the same utilities as the other graphs included in Design Center to the user, including logging, zooming, and tooltips.

The data transmission to this graph is enabled via the "Waveforms" Start/Stop command. To clear the current data on the screen, click the Clear button. To save the overall waveform data, click the Save Waveforms button.

The Debug waveform data is logged in the same file as the Absolute TOF, Delta ToF, and Volume Flow Rate data. If automatic data logging is enabled via Options â†’ Logging, then the debug waveform data will also be logged in the waveform data .csv file.

**Statistics**

Each Debug Plot has a statistics bar below providing the mean, min, max and std deviation of the last N samples, where N is selectable on the control panel bar.
