Revision History of Ultrasonic Software Library Releases
--------------------------------------------------------

Although Ultrasonic Software Library and Ultrasonic Design Center GUI are delivered together, the Ultrasonic Software Library has its own version tracking and change control. Every major library release comes with change control data in the Software Library API guide that describes any new features that have been added and any changes to existing functionality.
