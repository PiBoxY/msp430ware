System Requirements
===================

System Requirement Information
------------------------------

**Operating Systems**

Ultrasonic Sensing Solution Design Center is supported on Windows 7 or higher, Mac OS X 10.10.1+, and 64-bit Linux.

HID communication should work out of the box with non-Linux systems. For Linux systems, verification has only been completed on Ubuntu 14.04. Please perform the one-time setup steps below:

-  Create the file /etc/udev/rules.d/ti\_hid.rules
-  Add the lines below to the file and save it

::

    # Allow open access to any USB device with the default Texas Instruments MSP  
    # Vendor Id of 0x2047  
    ATTRS{idVendor}=="2047", MODE="0666"  

**Java Requirements**

Java 1.7 or higher is required to run the GUI. To install Java, please consult Oracle's download documentation located `here <https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml>`__.

**Runtime Recommendations**

While no minimum processor capability or RAM limit is enforced, it is recommended to have at least 4 GB of RAM and 2 processors to run the GUI. To achieve maximum speed performance, especially with respects to the ADC continuous capture at very high rates (10+ Hz), a 4 processor system is recommended. These requirements will allow the system to perform well at high HID polling rates.
