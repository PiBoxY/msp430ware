USS SW Library best practices
=============================

1. **Avoid accessing gUSSLEATempMemBlock until USS\_startUltrasonicMeasurement and USS\_startLowPowerUltrasonicCapture return control to the application**

   -  In order to avoid unexpected Non-maskable Interrupts during ``USS_startUltrasonicMeasurement`` or ``USS_startLowPowerUltrasonicCapture``, the application must ensure CPU or DMA does not attempt to access gUSSLEATempMemBlock buffer until the API retunr control to the application. For more information please refer to the `MSP430FR58xx, MSP430FR59xx, and MSP430FR6xx Users Guide <http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/slau367>`__ section "Data Transfer Controller (DTC) and Internal Data Buffer"
