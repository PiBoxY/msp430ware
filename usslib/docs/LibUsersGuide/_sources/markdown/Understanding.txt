Understanding the Ultrasonic Sensing Solution Library
=====================================================

Software Architecture
---------------------

The USS SW Library is split into three main components:

-  **Precompiled code** - Enables running the pre-define set of algorithms developed by Texas Instruments to calculate DtoF, AToF and volume flow rate.
-  **Source code** -
-  Enables configuration of USS and USS\_A module for ultrasonic firing and capture sequences

   -  If running the library on `EVM430-FR6043 <http://www.ti.com/tool/evm430-fr6043>`__ it allows users to control external circuitry on the EVM.

-  **USS SW Library Configuration files** - The following files allows configuration of the library in addition to calibration files. For more information regarding modifying the library configuration file please refer to `Modifying USS SW Library Configuration files <#modify>`__

The image below shows the software architecture of the library.
