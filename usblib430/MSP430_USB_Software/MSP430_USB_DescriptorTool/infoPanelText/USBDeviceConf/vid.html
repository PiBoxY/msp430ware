        <h1>Vendor ID</h1>
        <p>Associated descriptor field:  <span class="attribute">idVendor</span> (in the Device Descriptor)</p>
        <p>The VID is a 16-bit value assigned by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF, at www.usb.org).  Enter the value in the format 0xnnnn, where nnnn is a four-digit hex number.</p>
        <p>If your company has released USB products before, it may already have a VID.  If not, it can be obtained by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Becoming a member of the USB-IF.  This involves a $4000 annual fee. (http://www.usb.org/developers/vendor/)
            </li>
            <li>
                Licensing one from the USB-IF.  This costs $2000 for a two-year license. (http://www.usb.org/developers/vendor/)
            </li>
            <li>
                Licensing use of a single PID within TI's VID space (VID 0x2047). (http://www.ti.com/430usb)  This is available at no charge.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you haven't done this, and just want to experiment with the device or are just starting your development, TI-MSP430 has allocated a range of PIDs you can use within our VID space.  Use: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                VID = 0x2047
            </li>
            <li>
                PID = click the PID field to see its Help Pane text.
