        <h1>HID Report Type</h1>
        <p>HID interfaces can be of various subtypes.  The subtypes defined within the MSP430 USB API are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HID-Datapipe: used for unformatted point-to-point communication, similar to a COM port</li>
            <li>Mouse</li>
            <li>Keyboard</li>
            <li>Custom:  anything that isn't one of the three above</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The subtype determines the format of the HID report that will be used.</p>
        <p>HID-Datapipe is good for general-purpose communication, implementing an unformatted datastream.  On the MSP430 side, you can use send/receive API calls that look very similar to those used with CDC / virtual COM port.  USB examples #H0-H6 demonstrate HID-Datapipe.  </p>
        <p>"Keyboard" and "Mouse" create standard report descriptors for these kinds of devices.  However, you still need to write application code that sends reports over these interfaces.  See the H7/H8 examples in the USB Developers Package, for examples of mouse/keyboard code.</p>
        <p>With a selection of "Custom", you define your own report descriptor.  You can do this with the USB-IF's "HID Descriptor Tool" at www.usb.org.  (It has a similar name, but a very different function).  Paste the output from that tool into the popup field.  Then, use HID-Traditional API calls in your MSP430 application, to send/receive reports.</p>
