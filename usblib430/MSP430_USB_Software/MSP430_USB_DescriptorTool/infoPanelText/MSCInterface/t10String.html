        <h1>T10 Strings</h1>
        <p>Reported in the LUN's response to INQUIRY SCSI commands</p>
        <p>T10 is the standards body that defines SCSI.  Vendors are supposed to have a unique T10 vendor ID (VID), but there isn't much enforcement of this.  At this time, there is no fee to obtain a T10 Vendor ID.  http://www.t10.org/</p>
        <p>The product ID (PID) and revision are up to the vendor's discretion. </p>
        <p>Since these fields have little effect, and yet values are required, a checkbox is provided that automatically derives values from the USB VID/PID/revision.</p>
