        <h1>Removable Media</h1>
        <p>Affects the LUN's response to INQUIRY SCSI commands, to reflect removable media</p>
        <p>For LUNs having media that will remain permanently attached, leave the box unchecked.  For LUNs having media the user can remove at any time -- like memory cards -- check the box.</p>
        <p>Although technically any USB device can be "removed", this isn't what this box is referring to.  In that event, the USB device will de-enumerate.  In removable media, the USB device remains enumerated, but has no media. </p>
        <p>For every LUN reporting removable media, the host frequently pings it with  TEST_UNIT_READY SCSI command, to see if the media is still there.  LUNs not reporting removable media don't experience this.  </p>
        <p>If your device has more than one LUN, be sure to use the menu above to set this field for EACH logical unit. </p>
