 * Mass Storage with File System Emulation.
 *
 * This example demonstrates usage in which there is no file system software.  
 * Instead, a FAT volume is "emulated".  Also, the entire contents of the volume
 * are not stored inside the MSP430 flash; only few blocks are 
 * emulated, including the Master Boot Record, File Allocation Table, and 
 * Root Directory.
