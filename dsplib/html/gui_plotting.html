<h2>Frequency Response (Magnitude)</h2>
<p>The magnitude of the frequency response of the filter is the first tab shown in the center panel of the GUI. The frequency response allows for the user to view the anticipated effect on the amplitude of the output of signal for each frequency component [0, Nyquist Frequency] in decibels. Typically, higher order filters allow for better attenuation of bands targeted for removal at a higher run-time cost. Users can choose their filter type to best match their desired performance/run-time cost trade off; for example, multi-stage IIR filters can often achieve good attenuation/run-time cost performance, but can have wider swings in the phase response. In the IIR structure type for supported filters, Buttersworth filters typically have very flat passband attenuation and good rolloff for target bands.</p>
<h2>Phase Response</h2>
<p>The phasee response of the filter, also referred to as the group delay, allows for the user to visualize the time-shifting of output components of the signal at a range of [0, Nyquist Frequency] in angle degrees [-360, 360]. Phase Response allows for the user to view any erratic swings in phase; FIR filters typically have a linear or near-linear phase response, whereas IIR filters often have more erratic swings in phase, as the recursive nature of the output can result in quick shifts.</p>
<h2>Impulse Response</h2>
<p>The impulse response is intended to convey the magnitude of the coefficients and display the filter's response to an incoming brief signal train of all digital 1 values. The impulse response will display the coefficients in order and match the symmetry of the overall filter. Viewing the impulse response of an FIR filter can help the user gauge the reflection of the filter coefficients by examining the change between amplitude and distribution in response to different filter design parameters.</p>
<h2>Support</h2>
