 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430x24x Demo - ADC12, Repeated Single Channel Conversions
//
//  Description: This example shows how to perform repeated conversions on a
//  single channel using "repeat-single-channel" mode.  AVcc is used for the
//  reference and repeated conversions are performed on Channel A0. Each
//  conversion result is moved to an 8-element array called results[].  Test by
//  applying a voltage to channel A0, then running. Open a watch window in 
//  debugger and view the results. Set Breakpoint1 in the index increment line  
//  to see the array value change sequentially and Breakpoint2 to see the entire
//  array of conversion results in "results[]" for the specified Num_of_Results.
//  This can run even in LPM4 mode as ADC has its own clock
//
