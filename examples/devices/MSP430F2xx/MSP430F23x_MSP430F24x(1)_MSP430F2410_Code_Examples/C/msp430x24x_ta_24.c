 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430x24x Demo - Timer_A, Toggle P1.0, CCR0 Up Mode ISR, 32kHz INCLK
//
//  Description: Toggle P1.0 using software and the TA_0 ISR. Timer_A is
//  configured for up mode, thus the timer overflows when TAR counts
//  to CCR0. In this example, CCR0 is loaded with 1000-1.
//  ACLK = TACLK = INCLK = 32768Hz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO ~1.045Mhz
//  //* An external watch crystal on XIN XOUT is required for ACLK *//
