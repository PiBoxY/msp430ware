 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430x24x Demo - ADC12, Sample A10 Temp and Convert to oC and oF
//
//  Description: A single sample is made on A10 with reference to internal
//  1.5V Vref. Software sets ADC12SC to start sample and conversion - ADC12SC
//  automatically cleared at EOC. ADC12 internal oscillator times sample
//  and conversion. In Mainloop MSP430 waits in LPM0 to save power until
//  ADC10 conversion complete, ADC12_ISR will force exit from any LPMx in
//  Mainloop on reti.
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO ~1.045Mhz, ADC12CLK = ADC12OSC
// 
//  Uncalibrated temperature measured from device to devive will vary do to
//  slope and offset variance from device to device - please see datasheet.
