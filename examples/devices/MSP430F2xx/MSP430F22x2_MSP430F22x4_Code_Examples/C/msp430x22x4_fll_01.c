 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430F22x4 Demo - Basic Clock, Implement Auto RSEL SW FLL
//
//  Description: Set DCO clock to (Delta)*(4096) using software FLL. DCO clock
//  is output on P1.4 as SMCLK.  DCO clock, which is the selected SMCLK source
//  for timer_A is integrated over LFXT1/8 (4096) until SMCLK is is equal
//  to Delta.  CCR2 captures ACLK.  To use Set_DCO Timer_A must be
//  operating in continous mode.  Watch crystal for ACLK is required for
//  this example.  Delta must be kept in a range that allows possible
//  DCO speeds.  Minimum Delta must ensure that Set_DCO loop
//  can complete within capture interval. Maximum delta can be calculated by
//  f(DCOx7) / 4096.  f(DCOx7) can be found in device specific datasheet.
//  ACLK = LFXT1/8 = 32768/8, MCLK = SMCLK = target DCO
//  //* External watch crystal installed on XIN XOUT is required for ACLK *//
