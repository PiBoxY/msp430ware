 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430F22x4 Demo - Timer_A, PWM TA1-2, Up Mode, HF XTAL ACLK
//
//  Description: This program generates two PWM outputs on P1.2,3 using
//  Timer_A configured for up mode. The value in TACCR0, 512-1, defines the
//  period and the values in TACCR1 and TACCR2 the PWM duty cycles. Using
//  HF XTAL ACLK as TACLK, the timer period is HF XTAL/512 with a 75% duty
//  cycle on P1.2 and 25% on P1.3.
//  ACLK = MCLK = TACLK = HF XTAL
//  //* HF XTAL REQUIRED AND NOT INSTALLED ON FET *//
//  //* Min Vcc required varies with MCLK frequency - refer to datasheet *//
