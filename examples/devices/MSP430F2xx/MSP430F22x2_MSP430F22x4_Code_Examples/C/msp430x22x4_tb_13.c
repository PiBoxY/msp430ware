 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430F22x4 Demo - Timer_B, PWM TB1-2, Up/Down Mode, DCO SMCLK
//
//   Description: This program generates two PWM outputs on P4.1,2 using
//   Timer_B configured for up/down mode. The value in TBCCR0, 128, defines
//   the PWM period/2 and the values in TBCCR1-2 the PWM duty cycles. Using
//   ~1.2MHz SMCLK as TBCLK, the timer period is ~213us with a 75% duty
//   cycle on P4.1 and 25% on P4.2.
//   ACLK = n/a, SMCLK = MCLK = TBCLK = default DCO ~1.2MHz
//
