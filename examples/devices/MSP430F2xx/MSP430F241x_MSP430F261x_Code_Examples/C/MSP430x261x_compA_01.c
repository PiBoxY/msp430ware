 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430x26x Demo - Comparator A, Poll input CA0, result in P1.0
//
//   Description: The Voltage at pin CA0 (Vcompare) is compared with reference
//   voltage of 0.5*Vcc. LED is toggled when Vcompare crosses the ref voltage.
