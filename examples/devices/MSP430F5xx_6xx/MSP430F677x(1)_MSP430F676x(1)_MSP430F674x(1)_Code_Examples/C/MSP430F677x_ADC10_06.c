 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware

//  MSP430F67791 Demo - ADC10, Internal Reference toggle
//
//  Description: Sample and convert analog voltage at ADC input channel A1 in
//  single channel single conversion mode. Internal reference is toggled between
//  1.5V and 2.5V and the ADC measurements are made. With 1V input at A1, Vref+
//  of 1.5V and 2.5V gives ADC conversion result of ~682 and ~409 respectively.
//  LED at P1.0 is turned on when ADC conversion result >500 (that is with
//  Vref=1.5V) and turned off otherwise (when Vref=2.5V)
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO ~1.2MHz, ADC10CLK = ADC10OSC
//
