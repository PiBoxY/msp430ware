 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side

//  MSP430F543xA Demo - XT2 sources MCLK & SMCLK
//
//  Description: This program demonstrates using XT2 to source MCLK. XT1 is not
//  connected in this case.
//
//  By default, LFXT1 is requested by the following modules:
//     - FLL
//     - ACLK
//  If LFXT1 is NOT used and if the user does not change the source modules,
//  it causes the XT1xxOFIFG flag to be set because it is constantly looking
//  for LFXT1. OFIFG, global oscillator fault flag, will always be set if LFXT1
//  is set. Hence, it is important to ensure LFXT1 is no longer being sourced
//  if LFXT1 is NOT used.
//  MCLK = XT2
//  PMMCOREV = 2 to support up to 20MHz clock
//
//  NOTE: if the SMCLK/HF XTAL frequency exceeds 8MHz, VCore must be set
//  accordingly to support the system speed. Refer to MSP430x5xx Family User's Guide
//  Section 2.2 for more information.

//   Note: 
//   In order to run the system at up to 20MHz, VCore must be set at 1.8V
