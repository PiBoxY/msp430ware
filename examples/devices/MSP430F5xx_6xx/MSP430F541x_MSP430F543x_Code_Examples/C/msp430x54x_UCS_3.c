 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430F54x Demo - Software Toggle P1.0 with 12MHz DCO
//
//   Description: Toggle P1.0 by xor'ing P1.0 inside of a software loop.
//   ACLK is rought out on pin P11.0, SMCLK is brought out on P11.2, and MCLK
//   is brought out on pin P11.1.
//   ACLK = REFO = 32kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = 12MHz
