 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430F534x Demo - Bank Erase from a Block while Executing Code from Another
//                    Block.
//
//  Description: This program first writes to Bank 1 from 0x10000 to 0x10100.
//  Then a bank erase is done on Bank 1. During Bank erase, code is still
//  executing from Bank 0 by toggling P1.0. Toggling can only be seen by using
//  an oscilloscope.
//  Ensure Large memory model is selected.
//  ACLK = REFO = 32kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO 1048576Hz
//  //* Set Breakpoint on NOP in the Mainloop to avoid Stressing Flash *//
