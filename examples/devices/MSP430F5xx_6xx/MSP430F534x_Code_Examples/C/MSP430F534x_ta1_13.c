 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430F534x Demo - Timer1_A3, Toggle P1.7/TA1.0, Up/Down Mode, DCO SMCLK
//
//  Description: Toggle P1.7 using hardware TA1.0 output. Timer1_A is configured
//  for up/down mode with CCR0 defining period, TA1.0 also output on P1.1. In
//  this example, CCR0 is loaded with 250 and TA1.0 will toggle P1.1 at
//  TACLK/2*250. Thus the output frequency on P1.1 will be the TACLK/1000.
//  No CPU or software resources required.
//  As coded with TACLK = SMCLK, P1.7 output frequency is ~1.045M/1000.
//  SMCLK = MCLK = TACLK = default DCO ~1.045MHz
//
