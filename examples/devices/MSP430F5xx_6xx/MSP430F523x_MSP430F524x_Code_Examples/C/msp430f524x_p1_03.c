 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430F524x Demo - Software Port Interrupt Service on P1.4 from LPM4
//
//  Description: A Lo/Hi transition on P1.4 will trigger P1ISR the first time. 
//  On hitting the P1ISR, device exits LPM4 mode and executes section of code in
//  main() which includes toggling an LED and the P1.4IES bit which switches between 
//  Lo/Hi and Hi/Lo trigger transitions to alternatively enter the P1ISR. 
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
//
