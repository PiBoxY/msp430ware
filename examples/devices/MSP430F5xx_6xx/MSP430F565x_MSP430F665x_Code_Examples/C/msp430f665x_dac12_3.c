 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430F665x Demo - DAC12_0, Output Voltage Ramp on DAC0
//
//  Description: Using DAC12_0 and AVcc reference with a gain of 1,
//  output positive ramp on DAC0. Normal mode is LPM0 with CPU off.  WDT used
//  to provide ~61us interrupt used to wake up the CPU and update the DAC
//  with software. 
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
