 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430G22x0 Demo - Timer_A, Toggle P1.2, TA0CCR0 Cont. Mode ISR, DCO SMCLK
//
//  Description: Toggle P1.2 using software and TA_0 ISR. Toggles every
//  50000 SMCLK cycles. SMCLK provides clock source for TACLK.
//  During the TA_0 ISR, P1.2 is toggled and 50000 clock cycles are added to
//  TA0CCR0. TA_0 ISR is triggered every 50000 cycles. CPU is normally off and
//  used only during TA_ISR.
//  ACLK = VLO, MCLK = SMCLK = TACLK = default DCO
