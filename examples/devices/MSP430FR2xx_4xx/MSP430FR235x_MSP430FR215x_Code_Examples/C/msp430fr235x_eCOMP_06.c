 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

// MSP430FR235x Demo - eCOMP Toggle from LPM3; eCOMP in ultra low power mode,
//                     compare two channels(P1.0, P1.1) input voltage.
//
// Description: Use eCOMP to compare two channels input voltage.
//    When P1.0 voltage exceeds P1.1 voltage, CPOUT goes high
//    When P1.1 voltage exceeds P1.0 voltage, CPOUT goes low.
