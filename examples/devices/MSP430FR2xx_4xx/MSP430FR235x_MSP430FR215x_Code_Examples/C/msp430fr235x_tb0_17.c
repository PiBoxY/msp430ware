 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430FR235x Demo - Timer0_B3, PWM TB0.1-2, Up Mode, 32KHz ACLK
//
//  Description: This program generates two PWM outputs on P1.6,P1.7 using
//  Timer0_B configured for up mode. The value in CCR0, 100-1, defines the PWM
//  period and the values in CCR1 and CCR2 the PWM duty cycles. Using 32768Hz
//  ACLK as TBCLK, the timer period is ~3ms with a 75% duty cycle on P1.6
//  and 25% on P1.7.
//  ACLK =TBCLK = XT1~32768Hz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCODIV ~1MHz
//
