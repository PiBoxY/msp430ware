 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430FR235x Demo - Timer0_B3 Capture of ACLK
//
//  Description; Capture a number of periods of the ACLK clock and store them in an array.
//  When the set number of periods is captured the program is trapped and the LED on
//  P1.0 is toggled. At this point halt the program execution read out the values using
//  the debugger.
//  ACLK = REFOCLK = 32kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCODIV = 1MHz.
