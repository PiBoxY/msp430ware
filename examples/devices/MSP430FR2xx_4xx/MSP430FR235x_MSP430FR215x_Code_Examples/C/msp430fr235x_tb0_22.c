 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430FR235x Demo - Timer_B, Ultra-Low Power Pulse Accumulator
//
//   Description: Timer_B is used as ultra-low power pulse counter. In this
//   example TBR is offset 20 counts, which are accumulated on TB0CLK P2.7,
//   with the system in LPM4 - all internal clocks off. After 20 counts, TBR
//   will overflow requesting an interrupt, and wake up the system. Timer_B is
//   then reconfigured with SMCLK as clock source in up mode - TBCCR2 will then
//   toggle P1.0 every 50000 SMCLK cycles.
//
