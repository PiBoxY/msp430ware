 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP-FET430P120 Demo - Timer_A, Toggle P1.1/TA0, Up Mode, DCO SMCLK
//
//  Description: Toggle P1.1 using hardware TA0 output. Timer_A is configured
//  for up mode with CCR0 defining period, TA0 also output on P1.1. In this
//  example, CCR0 is loaded with 500-1 and TA0 will toggle P1.1 at TACLK/500.
//  Thus the output frequency on P1.1 will be the TACLK/1000.  No CPU or software
//  resources required.
//  ACLK = n/a, SMCLK = MCLK = TACLK = default DCO ~800kHz
//  As coded with TACLK = SMCLK, P1.1 output frequency is ~800000/1000
//
