 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP-FET430P120 Demo - Basic Clock, MCLK Sourced from HF XTAL
//
//  Description: Proper selection of an external HF XTAL for MCLK is shown by
//  first polling the OSC fault until XTAL is stable - only then is MCLK
//  sourced by LFXT1.  MCLK/10 is on P1.1 driven by a software loop taking
//  exactly 10 CPU cycles.
//  ACLK = MCLK = LFXT1 = HF XTAL
//  //* HF XTAL NOT INSTALLED ON FET *//
//  //* Min Vcc required varies with MCLK frequency - refer to datasheet *//	
//
