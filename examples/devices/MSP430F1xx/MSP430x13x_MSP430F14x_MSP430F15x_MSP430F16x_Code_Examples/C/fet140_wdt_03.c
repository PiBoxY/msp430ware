 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP-FET430P140 Demo - WDT, Toggle P1.0, Interval Overflow ISR, HF XTAL ACLK
//
//  Description: Toggle P1.0 using software timed by the WDT ISR. In this
//  example the WDT is clocked with ACLK which is the same as the XTAL and
//  divided by the WDT by 512 triggering and ISR that will toggle P1.0.
//  ACLK= MCLK= LFXT1= HF XTAL
//  //* HF XTAL REQUIRED AND NOT INSTALLED ON FET *//
//  //* Min Vcc required varies with MCLK frequency - refer to datasheet *//
