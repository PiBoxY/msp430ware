 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP-FET430P140 Demo - Timer_B, PWM TB1-2, Up Mode, HF XTAL ACLK
//
//  Description: This program generates two PWM outputs on P4.1,2 using
//  Timer_B configured for up mode. The value in CCR0, 512-1, defines the PWM
//  period and the values in CCR1 and CCR2 the PWM duty cycles. Using HF XTAL
//  ACLK as TBCLK, the timer period is HF XTAL/512 with a 75% duty cycle
//  on P4.1 and 25% on P4.2.
//  ACLK = MCLK = TBCLK = HF XTAL
//  //* HF XTAL REQUIRED AND NOT INSTALLED ON FET *//
//  //* Min Vcc required varies with MCLK frequency - refer to datasheet *//
