 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP-FET430P140 Demo - ADC12, Using the Internal Reference
//
//  Description: This example shows how to use the internal reference of the ADC12.
//  It uses the internal 2.5V reference and performs a single conversion
//  on channel A0. The conversion results are stored in ADC12MEM0. Test by
//  applying a voltage to channel A0, then setting and running to a break point
//  at the "_NOP()" instruction. To view the conversion results, open an ADC12
//  register window in debugger and view the contents of ADC12MEM0.
