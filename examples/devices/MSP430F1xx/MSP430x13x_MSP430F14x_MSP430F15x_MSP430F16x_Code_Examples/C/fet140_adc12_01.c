 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP-FET430P140 Demo - ADC12, Sample A0, Set P1.0 if A0 > 0.5*AVcc
//
//  Description: A single sample is made on A0 with reference to AVcc.
//  Software sets ADC10SC to start sample and conversion - ADC12SC
//  automatically cleared at EOC. ADC12 internal oscillator times sample (16x)
//  and conversion. In Mainloop MSP430 waits in LPM0 to save power until ADC12
//  conversion complete, ADC12_ISR will force exit from LPM0 in Mainloop on
//  reti. If A0 > 0.5*AVcc, P1.0 set, else reset.
//
