 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware

//  C430F514x Demo - ADC10, Sample A11, Lo_Batt, Clear P1.0 if AVcc < 2.3V
//
//  Description: A single sample is made on A11 (AVcc/2) with reference to
//  internal 1.5V Vref. Software sets ADC10SC to start sample and conversion
//  - ADC10SC automatically cleared at EOC. ADC10 internal oscillator times
//  sample (16x) and conversion. ADC10BUSY flag is polled for EOC. If A11
//  (AVcc/2) < 0311h (1.15V) indicating AVcc is less 2.3V, P1.0 reset indicating
//  a lo_Batt condition, else set.
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO ~1.2MHz, ADC10CLK = ADC10OSC
//
