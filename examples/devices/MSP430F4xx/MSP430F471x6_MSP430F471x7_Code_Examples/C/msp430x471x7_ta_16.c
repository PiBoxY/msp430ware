 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430x471xx Demo - Timer_A, PWM TA1-2 Up Mode, DCO SMCLK
//
//  Description: This program outputs two PWM signals on P1.2 and P3.4
//  using Timer_A configured for up mode. The value in CCR0 defines the PWM
//  period and the values in CCR1 and CCR2 the PWM duty cycles. Using SMCLK as
//  TACLK, the timer period is 488us with a 75% duty cycle on P1.2 and 25%
//  on P3.4.
//  ACLK = LFXT1 = 32768Hz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO = 32 x ACLK = 1048576Hz
//  //* An external watch crystal between XIN & XOUT is required for ACLK *//	
//
