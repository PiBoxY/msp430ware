 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430x471xx Demo - SD16, Single Conversion on Single Channel Polling IFG
//
//  Description: This program uses the SD16 module to perform a single
//  conversion on a single channel. The SD16 interrupt flag for CH2 is polled
//  to determine when a conversion has completed. Test by applying a voltage
//  to CH2 (A2.0+, A2.0-) and setting a breakpoint at the line indicated
//  below. Run program until it reaches the breakpoint, then use the
//  debugger's register window to view the conversion results. The conversion
//  result for CH2 is variable results. 
//  ACLK = LFXT1 = 32768 Hz, MCLK = SMCLK = DCO = 32 x ACLK = 1048576 Hz
//  //* An external watch crystal on XIN XOUT is required for ACLK     *//	
//  //* For minimum Vcc required for SD16 module - see datasheet        *//
//  //* 100nF cap btw Vref and AVss is recommended when using 1.2V ref *//
