 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430x47xx Demo - FLL+, MCLK Configured to Operate from XT2 HF XTAL
//
//   Description: Proper selection of an external HF XTAL for MCLK is
//   demonstrated using HF XT2 OSC.  OFIFG is polled until the HF XTAL
//   is stable - only then is MCLK sourced by XT2.  MCLK is buffered on P1.1.
//   //** HF XTAL NOT INSTALLED ON FET **//
