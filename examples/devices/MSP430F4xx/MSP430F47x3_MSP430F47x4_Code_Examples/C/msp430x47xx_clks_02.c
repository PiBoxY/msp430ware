 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430x47xx Demo - FLL+, Output 32kHz Xtal + HF Xtal + Internal DCO
//
//  Description:  This program demonstrates using an external 32kHz crystal to
//  supply ACLK, and using a high speed crystal or resonator to supply SMCLK.
//  MLCK for the CPU is supplied by the internal DCO.  The 32kHz crystal
//  connects between pins Xin and Xout. The high frequency crystal or
//  resonator connects between pins XT2IN and XT2OUT.  The DCO clock is
//  generated internally and calibrated from the 32kHz crystal.  ACLK is
//  brought out on pin P1.5, SMCLK is brought out on P1.4, and MCLK is
//  brought out on pin P1.1.
//  ACLK = LFXT1 = 32768Hz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO = 32 x ACLK = 1048576Hz
//  //* An external watch crystal between XIN & XOUT is required for ACLK *//	
//
//  NOTE: External matching capacitors must be added for the high
//       speed crystal or resonator as required.
