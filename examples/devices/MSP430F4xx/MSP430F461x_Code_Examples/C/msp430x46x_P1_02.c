 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430F461x Demo - Software Port Interrupt on P1.4 from LPM4
//
//   Description: A hi/low transition on P1.4 will trigger P1_ISR which,
//   toggles P5.1. Normal mode is LPM4 ~ 0.1uA. LPM4 current can be measured
//   with the LED removed, all unused P1.x/P2.x configured as output or inputs
//   pulled high or low, and ensure the P2.0 interrupt input does not float.
//   ACLK = 32.768kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
//
