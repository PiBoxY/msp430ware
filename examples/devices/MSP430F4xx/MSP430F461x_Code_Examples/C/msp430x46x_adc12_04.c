 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430F461x Demo - ADC12, Extend Sampling Period with SHT Bits
//
//   This example shows how to extend the sampling time using the sampling
//   timer. In this example, the ADC12OSC is used to provide the sampling period
//   and the SHT0 bits are set to extend the sampling period to 4xADC12CLKx256.
//   A single conversion is performed on channel A0. The A/D conversion results
//   are stored in ADC12MEM0 and are moved to R5 upon completion of the
//   conversion. Test by setting and running to a break point at
//   "__no_operation()". Use the debugger to inspect 'ADCResult'.
//   ACLK = 32kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO 1048576Hz, ADC12CLK = ADC12OSC
//
