 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430F461x Demo - ADC12, Sequence of Conversions (non-repeated)
//
//  This example shows how to perform A/D conversions on a sequence of channels.
//  A single sequence of conversions is performed - one conversion each on
//  channels A0, A1, A2, and A3. Each conversion uses AVcc and AVss for the
//  references. The conversion results are stored in ADC12MEM0, ADC12MEM1,
//  ADC12MEM2, and ADC12MEM3 respectively and are moved to Results[] upon
//  completion of the sequence. Test by applying voltages to pins A0, A1, A2,
//  and A3, then setting and running to a break point at the "__no_operation()"
//  instruction in the ISR. To view the conversion results, open a watch window
//  with the debugger and view Results[] or view ADC12MEM0, ADC12MEM1,
//  ADC12MEM2, and ADC12MEM3 in a register window.
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO, ADC12CLK = ADC12OSC
//
//  Note that a sequence has no restrictions on which channels are converted.
//  For example, a valid sequence could be A0, A3, A2, A4, A2, A1, A0, and A7.
//  See the MSP430x4xx User's Guide for instructions on using the ADC12
//  ACLK = 32kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO 1048576Hz, ADC12CLK = ADC12OSC
