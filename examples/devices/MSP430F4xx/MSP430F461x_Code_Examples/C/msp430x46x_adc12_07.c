 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430F461x Demo - ADC12, Repeated Single Channel Conversions
//
//  This example shows how to perform repeated conversions on a single channel
//  using "repeat-single-channel" mode.  AVcc is used for the reference and
//  repeated conversions are performed on Channel A0. Each conversion result
//  is moved to an 8-element array called Results[].  Test by applying a
//  voltage to channel A0, then running. To view the conversion results, open a
//  watch window with the debugger and view Results[].
//  ACLK = 32kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO 1048576Hz, ADC12CLK = ADC12OSC
//
