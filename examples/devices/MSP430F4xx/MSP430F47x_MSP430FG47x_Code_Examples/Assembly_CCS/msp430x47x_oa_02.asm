;                        MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
; 
;  MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
;  demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
;  concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
;  register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
;  be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
;  effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
;  for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

;   MSP430x479 Demo - OA0, Comparator in General-Purpose Mode
;
;   Description: Use OA0 as a comparator in general-purpose mode. In this
;   example, OA0 is configured for general-purpose mode, but used as a
;   comparator. The reference is supplied by DAC12_0 on the "-" input.
;   The "+" terminal is connected to OA0I0.
;   ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
