 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430x41x2 Demo - Basic Timer, Toggle P5.1 Inside ISR, 32kHz ACLK
//
//  Description: Toggles P5.1 by xor'ing P5.1 inside of a basic timer ISR.
//  ACLK provides the basic timer clock source. LED toggles every 125ms.
//  ACLK = LFXT1 = 32768Hz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO = 32 x ACLK = 1048576Hz
//  //* An external watch crystal between XIN & XOUT is required for ACLK *//
//
