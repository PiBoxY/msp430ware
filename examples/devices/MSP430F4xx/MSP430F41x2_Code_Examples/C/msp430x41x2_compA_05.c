 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430x41x2 Demo - Comparator A, Poll input CA0, interrupt triggered
//
//   Description:  Normal operation is in LPM3.  When Vcompare crosses the ref
//   voltage, an interrupt is generated, and the ISR toggles the LED.
//
