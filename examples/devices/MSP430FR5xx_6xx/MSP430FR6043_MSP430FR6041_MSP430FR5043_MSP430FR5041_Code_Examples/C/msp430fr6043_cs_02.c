 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430FR60xx Demo - Configure MCLK for 16MHz operation
//
//   Description: Configure SMCLK = MCLK = 16MHz, ACLK = VLOCLK
//   IMPORTANT NOTE: While the FR6043 is capable of operation w/ MCLK = 16MHz
//   the throughput of the device is dependent on accesses to FRAM.
//   The maximum speed for accessing FRAM is limited to 8MHz and it is required
//   to manually configure a waitstate for MCLK frequencies beyond 8MHz. Refer
//   to the FRCTL chapter of the User's Guide for further information.
