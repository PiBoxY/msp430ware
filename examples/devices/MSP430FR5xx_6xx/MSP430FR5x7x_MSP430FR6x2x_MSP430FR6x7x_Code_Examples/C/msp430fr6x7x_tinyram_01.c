 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430FR6x7x Demo - Store global variable in Tiny RAM and toggle LED
//
//  Description: Example demonstrates how to allocate a global counter variable
//  into Tiny RAM. The variable gets incremented in an endless loop each time
//  the LED on P1.0 gets blinked.
//  Background: MSP430FR697x devices have a very small additional section of
//  RAM called Tiny RAM that can be used by the user as extra storage - see
//  device datasheet for details. The RAM is available in LPM3/LPM4 even when
//  the main RAM is powered down. Note that for most use cases/applications,
//  there is no need to use Tiny RAM. Let the toolchain take care of allocating
//  data in the regular FRAM/RAM regions.
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
//
