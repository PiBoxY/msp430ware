 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430FR69xx Demo - Timer1_A3, PWM TA1.1-2, Up Mode, DCO SMCLK
//
//  Description: This program generates two PWM outputs on P1.2,P1.3 using
//  Timer1_A configured for up mode. The value in CCR0, 1000-1, defines the PWM
//  period and the values in CCR1 and CCR2 the PWM duty cycles. Using ~1MHz
//  SMCLK as TACLK, the timer period is ~1ms with a 75% duty cycle on P1.2
//  and 25% on P1.3.
//  ACLK = n/a, SMCLK = MCLK = TACLK = 1MHz
//
