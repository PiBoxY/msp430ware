 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430FR59x Demo - COMPE Hysteresis, COUT Toggle in LPM4; High speed mode
//
//  Description: Use CompE and shared reference to determine if input 'Vcompare'
//  is high or low.  Shared reference is configured to generate hysteresis.
//  When Vcompare exceeds Vcc*3/4 COUT goes high and when Vcompare is less
//  than Vcc*1/4 then COUT goes low.
