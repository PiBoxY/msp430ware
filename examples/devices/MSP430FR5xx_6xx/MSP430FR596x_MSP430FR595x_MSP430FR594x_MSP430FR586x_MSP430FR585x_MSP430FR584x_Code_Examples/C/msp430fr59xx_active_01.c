 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430FR59xx Demo - Stay in active mode with MCLK = 8MHz
//
//   Description:
//   The activeModeTest() function is intended to mimic a typical cache hit
//   ratio for a real world application. The code itself is a combination of
//   move, jump and math operations performed in an infinite loop.
//   The active power for a typical cache hit ratio using MCLK=8MHz is measured
//
//   ACLK = VLO, MCLK = SMCLK = 8MHz
//
