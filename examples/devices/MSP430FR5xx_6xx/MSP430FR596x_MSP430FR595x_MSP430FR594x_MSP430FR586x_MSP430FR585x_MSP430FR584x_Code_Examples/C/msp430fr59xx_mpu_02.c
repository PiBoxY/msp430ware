 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430FR59x Demo - MPU Write protection violation - PUC
//
//  Description: The MPU segment boundaries are defined by:
//  Border 1 = 0x6000 [MPUSEGB1 = 0x0600]
//  Border 2 = 0x8000 [MPUSEGB2 = 0x0800]
//  Segment 1 = 0x4400 - 0x5FFF
//  Segment 2 = 0x6000 - 0x7FFF
//  Segment 3 = 0x8000 - 0x13FFF
//  Segment 2 is write protected. Any write to an address in the segment 2 range
//  causes a PUC. The LED toggles after reset once MPUSEG2IFG is set. A delay is included
//  so the debugger can gain access via JTAG.
//
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = default DCO = 1MHz
//
