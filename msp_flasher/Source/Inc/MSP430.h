 * \mainpage MSP430 DLL API Documentation
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * The MSP430.DLL is the interface between the JTAG/EEM (Enhanced Emulation Module)
 * on the MSP430 and the IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The DLL usually is
 * running on the same platform the IDE is running.
 *
 * The MSP430.dll consists of three parts:
 * - one for the basic functions like initializing the hardware interface to the device,
 *   setting the supply voltage, erasing and programming an MSP430 device.\n
 *   All of these functions are available via the MSP430.h header file.
 * - a second part to enable debugging user code programmed in the device's
 *   flash memory. The documentation describes the Application Programming Interface (API)
 *   to access the Enhanced Emulation Module (EEM) of a MSP430 device
 *   using the MSP430.DLL. Referenced within this documentation as EEM API.\n
 *   TI recommends to use the Application Programming Interface (API) defined through
 *   MSP430_EEM.h to access the Enhanced Emulation Module (EEM) of an MSP430 device.
 *   For downward compatibility reasons to former releases of this DLL the functions
 *   declared in MSP430_Debug.h are still available but should UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
 *   be mixed with the funtions of the newer EEM API.
 *   The DLL provides the following functionalities:\n
 *   - Caller notifying mechanism using callback notify mechanism
 *   - Autonom detection of state changes (e.g. breakpoint hit)\n
 * - and a third part to maintain the MSP-FET430UIF (TI USB FET) hardware and firmware.
 *   Defined through functions and definitions in MSP430_FET.h

/**
\fn    STATUS_T MSP430_Initialize(const char* port, int32_t* version);

\brief   Initialize the interface.

\note    1. This function must be called first.
\note    2. MSP430_VCC() must be called second (after MSP430_Initialize() is called).
\note    3. When initializing the MSP-FET430UIF (TI USB FET) parameter 'version' could
            contain the value -1 or -3. This means that the Dll and the MSP-FET430UIF do not
            have the same version (-3 means a major internal update is required).
            MSP430_FET_FwUpdate() should be called.
            MSP430_FET_FwUpdate() is part of the Maintenance API of the Dll.
            When -3 was returned and calling MSP430_FET_FwUpdate(), the file CDC.log must exist
            in the directory of the executed binary and the content must be the string "True"
            without a newline. This file signals that a CDC driver is installed and prevents
            the update from making the MSP-FET430UIF unusable.

\param   port:    Interface port reference (application specific).
                  - To initialize TI's MSP-FET430UIF USB Jtag adapter the parameter
                    port should point to the string 'TIUSB' or just 'USB'.
                  - TI's MSP-FET430UIF USB Jtag adapter create Virtual Com Ports (VCPs)
                    on the PC system (see Device Manager). It is also possible to directly
                    pass the name of a dedicated VCP via this parameter (e.g. 'COM4, COM23,...).
                    This can be used to support multiple MSP-FET430UIF interfaces on one PC.
                    The later generation of USB development tools (eZ430-RF2500) no longer
                    uses the VCP approach. These tools enumerate as Human Interface Devices (HID)
                    on the USB. Since DLL version 2.03.00.000 it is also possible to directly
                    pass the name of a dedicated HID via this parameter.
                    When using a v3 MSP-FET430UIF it is enumerated as Communication Device Class (CDC).
                    Refer to MSP430_GetNumberOfUsbIfs() and MSP430_GetNameOfUsbIf()
                    for more information on VCP, HID and CDC.
\param   version: The version number of the MSP430 DLL is returned (if version is not NULL).
                  A value of -1 or -3 reports a version conflict between the Dll and USB FET f/w.
                  In that case please refer to MSP430_FET_FwUpdate() on how to update
                  the firmware of the MSP-FET430UIF.

            MSP430_Configure(LOCKED_FLASH_ACCESS,...) can be used to unlock/lock this segment.
            Having parameter 'type' set to ERASE_ALL will erase the complete INFO memory in case

            Doing so will fill the erased memory with 0xFFFF to be consistent with FLASH devices.
