 \file MSP430_Debug.h

 \brief       This file contains the DLL function headers and definitions
              to support the debugging functions of the MSP430.DLL

              The MSP430.DLL provides the following debug functionalities:
              - Read/Write CPU registers
              - Set/Clear code breakpoints
              - Single step/Run to breakpoint/Free run the CPU
              - Get CPU state
              - Access the Enhanced Emultation Module registers

 \attention   The debugging functions of the DLL are made available only
              to third party tool developers. Using the Enhanced Emulation Module
              API strictly permits the usage of the functions provided via this
              header file. The functions are only made available due to downward
              compatibility reasons.

 \par         Project:
              MSP430 JTAG Interface (MSP430.dll)

 \par         Developed using:
              MS Visual C++ 2003/2010

 \brief     EEM (Extended) General Clock Control.

 \note      Note 1: Not recommended for use with MSP430_Configure(CLK_CNTRL_MODE, <bits>);

 \note      Note 2: ST_ACLK, ST_SMCLK, and JT_FLLO *are* supported by the EEM Extended General Clock Control register;
            Their definitions were commented-out so as not to conflict with the identical definitions for the
			EEM General Clock Control register.

 \full      In addition to the above EEM Extended General Clock Control register features, the MSP430F449
            supports four emulation modes (EMU_MODE_F4xx_xxx) using the EEM General Control register.
			Use function MSP430_Configure(EMULATION_MODE, <bits>); to configure the bits of the EEM General Control
			register.

 \note      Note 1. Only the EMU_MODE_F4xx_xxx bits are supported by EMULATION_MODE.

 \note      Note 2. MSP430_Configure(EMULATION_MODE, <bits>); will reset the device with PUC in order to change the
            emulation mode.

\brief   Determine the state of the device. The device is optionally stopped.
         During single step operations, a count of CPU cycles executed is maintained.

\note    1. MSP430_OpenDevice() must have been called prior to calling this function.
\note    2. Limitations:
			- After MSP430_Run() was called DO NOT call MSP430_State() other than with
			  parameter 'stop' set to TRUE.
			- Calling MSP430_State() with parameter 'stop' set to TRUE will cause the device's CPU
			  to be stopped. DLLv3 will block until the device is stopped.
			- When the device's CPU is not running (MSP430_Run() was not called prior) MSP430_State()
			  can be called without any restrictions.
\note    3. To determine the device state, the JTAG control signals are required. If the JTAG control signals were
	        released, the signals are reconnected.
\note    4. The number of CPU cycles executed is zeroed when the device is reset (MSP430_Reset()), and when the
            device is run (MSP430_Run()) with FREE_RUN and RUN_TO_BREAKPOINT.

            to this function as parameter 2 (see application example for details).

\param   localDeviceId: Not currently used. Always returns module names for current device.
\param   CcModuleNames:	A pointer to a pointer of the struct type EemMclkCtrl_t
                        defined in MSP430_Debug.h (see application example).
\code
  Application example:

  #include "MSP430_Debug.h"

  EemMclkCtrl_t* globalCcModuleNames;

  MSP430_CcGetModuleNames(deviceId, &globalCcModuleNames);

\endcode
