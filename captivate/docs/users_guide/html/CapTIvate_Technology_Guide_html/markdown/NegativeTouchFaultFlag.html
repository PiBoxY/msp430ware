		<B>Negative Touch Flag</B>
		<P>
		The Negative Touch flag is set when negative touch is detected. The negative touch threshold provides a mechanism for detecting when an element's measurement 
		count adjusts quickly in the direction opposite of a touch.  This scenario might happen during
		device power-up if a user has their hand covering an electrode during power-up calibration.  The library
		makes the assumption at power-up that there is no user interaction.  This may not always be the case.  If 
		the system is calibrated with a user touching a sensor, when they remove their hand, the measurements from that
		sensor's elements will quickly adjust in the opposite direction of a touch.  Setting a negative touch threshold provides
		a way to quickly detect this event.  Upon detection, the application will re-calibrate to ensure 
		full sensitivity from the electrode immediately following the "negative" touch.
