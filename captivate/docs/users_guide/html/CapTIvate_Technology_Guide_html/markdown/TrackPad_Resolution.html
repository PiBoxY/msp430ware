		<P>
		
		The desired resolution parameters specifies the resolution of the position that is calculated by the trackpad processing algorithm.
		The trackpad is a two-dimensional sensor that reports back an x-position and y-position.  When selecting a resolution, the value
		reported back for the position will be in the range of 0 to (resolution-1).  For example, if a resolution of 1000 is selected, the
		values will range from 0 to 999 (1000 total points of interest).

		<BR>
		While resolutions up to 16-bit are supported by the algorithm, the default resolution is 1000 points.  Select a resolution that
		is appropriate for the application.
