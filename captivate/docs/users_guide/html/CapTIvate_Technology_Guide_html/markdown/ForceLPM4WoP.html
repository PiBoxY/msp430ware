		<B>Force Low Power Mode 4 (LPM4) in Wake-on-Prox Mode</B><BR>
		
        <P>Select this option to use the very low power oscillator
        (VLO) as the conversion timer in wake-on-proximity mode in LPM4.  This option may 
        be used to reduce the average current in wake-on-proximity mode for designs 
        that do not have a crystal oscillator.
        
        <P>If this option is defined, LPM4 will 
        be selected as the power mode during wake-on-proximity operation, disabling ACLK and along with it XT1 or the 
        REFO, whichever was sourcing ACLK previously, while the system is in WOP mode.  
        When WOP mode is exited and active mode is entered, ACLK will again be 
        utilized to source the conversion timer and the application-selected low 
        power mode (g_uiApp.ui8AppLPM) will be used until WOP mode is again entered.
        
        <P><I>Notes</I>
        <P>If this mode is selected and the VLO is used, the tolerance
        on the measured scan period will be poor.  For example, if 10 Hz (100ms)
        is the selected WOP scan rate, this value may vary by as much as +/- 5 Hz
        across temperature and voltage.  If this variance is too great for the
        application requirements, a 32kHz crystal or the REFO should be used instead.
