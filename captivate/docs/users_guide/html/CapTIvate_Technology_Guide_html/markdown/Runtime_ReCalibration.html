		<P>
		
		The runtime re-calibration feature provides a runtime check of each element
		in the sensor to ensure that it is within the resolution and sensitivity band that was specified.
		The conversion count and conversion gain parameters (in the <I>Conversion Control</I>
		section) specify the desired measurement resolution and sensitivity for the sensor.
		At device power-up, each element in the sensor is calibrated according to these values.
		However, environmental drift due to temperature, voltage, humidity, and other factors
		may cause elements within the sensor to slowly drift from their initial calibration target over time.
		<P>
		Run-time re-calibration, if enabled, checks each element after every measurement to ensure that
		the long term average (LTA) is within range of the specified conversion count.  If the LTA happens
		to drift out of range, the sensor will be re-calibrated to bring the LTA back in line with the 
		specified conversion count.  The valid range is +/- 1/8th of the conversion count, as shown in the
		equation below.

		The plot below shows the valid and invalid ranges for the LTA if the conversion count is specified as
		600.  If the LTA tracks into an invalid range, the sensor will be re-calibrated to return the LTA and count
		to the specified conversion count.

		<B>Implementation Notes</B>
		<BR>
		For most applications, runtime re-calibration should be enabled to ensure that the sensor is
		always being measured in the desired sensitivity band.
