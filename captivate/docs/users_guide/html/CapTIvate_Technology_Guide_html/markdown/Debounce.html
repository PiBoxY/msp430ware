		<B>De-Bounce</B>

		De-bouncing a capacitive touch sensor helps to ensure robust operation in noisy environments
		by providing control over how touch and proximity states are entered and exited.
		It works by requiring a sensor going through a state change (no-touch into touch, or touch into no-touch)
		to be in the new state for a certain number of samples before the state is actually updated in software.
		For example: with de-bounce switched off (set to 0), as soon as a touch threshold crossing occurs
		the touch state will be updated accordingly.  If the de-bounce feature is switched on,
		and set to 1, a threshold crossing will not effect the state unless the measurement stays past
		the threshold for at least 1 (initial sample) + 1 (debounce sample) = 2 total samples.
		
		<P>
		
		Take the plot below as an example.  The measurement results (over time for several samples) 
		are plotted in the <I>Count</I> series.  The <I>Threshold Crossing</I> logical series indicates 
		when <I>Count</I> has passed the <I>Touch Threshold</I>.  If no de-bounce is applied, then the 
		<I>Touch State</I>, or our final output, will always be equal to the <I>Threshold Crossing</I>.
		In this example, let's assume that the second spike is due to noise- not a touch.  De-bounce
		can be used to suppress this event so that it does not effect the touch state.  If a de-bounce
		threshold of 2 is set, the second spike (the noise spike) does not remain past the threshold long
		enough to trigger a touch state.  Now that de-bounce is applied, the <I>Touch State</I> is no
		longer equal to the <I>Threshold Crossing</I>.

		De-bounce may be applied to touch or proximity state detection.
		The thresholds may be set independently for touch and prox, as well
		as the rising edge (into a touch/prox state) and falling edge (out of a touch/prox state).
		Below is an example of a successful de-bounce (touch state entered) and an unsuccessful debounce
		(touch state not entered).

		The falling edge feature (de-bounce out) is particularly useful when it is undesirable to
		detect a "new" touch if a user accidentally lets go of a button for a short period of time,
		and then returns it.  The plots below demonstrate a successful exit of a touch state, and an
		unsuccessful exit (a temporary removal).

		<B>Implementation Notes</B>
		<BR>
		De-bounce configurations are set on a sensor basis.  All elements within a sensor will share
		the same de-bounce thresholds.  There are four thresholds that may be set:
		<BR> - Proximity De-Bounce In
		<BR> - Proximity De-Bounce Out
		<BR> - Touch De-Bounce In
		<BR> - Touch De-Bounce Out
		<P>
		It is important to note that applying de-bounce to a sensor increases the response time of the sensor.
		For example, if a system is set up to measure at a 20 Hz rate (every 50 ms), a de-bounce of 1 increases
		the response time to a touch from 50ms to 100ms.  This delay is in addition to any delay imposed by
		count filtering.  If heavy de-bounce is to be used, it may be necessary to increase the sample rate.
		
		<P>
		<B>Range of Valid Values for De-bounce Thresholds</B>
		<BR>
		De-bounce thresholds may be set between 0 and 15.  Zero is equivalent to no de-bounce.
