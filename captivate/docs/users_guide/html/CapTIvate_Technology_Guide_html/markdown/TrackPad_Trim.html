		<B>TrackPad Trim</B>
		<P>
		
		A typical trackpad layout consists of diamond shape electrodes that fill the surface of the active area. Around the perimeter of the trackpad 
		there is a non-linear or "dead-zone" where the trackpad may not respond to a finger touch.
		
		<P>

		<P>
		
		Trackpad trim parameters provide a way to help "stretch" or scale the left, right, upper and lower end points of a trackpad to compensate for
		this effect.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		The desired operation of a trackpad is to have the left-most or bottom-most point be represented by the lowest possible value (0), and the
		right-most or top-most point be represented by the maximum possible value (resolution of the trackpad - 1).  
		This concept is illustrated in the example below.  
				
		<P>
		<B>Implementation Notes</B>
		<BR>
		To tune the left and lower parameters, move your finger along the edge of the trackpad and determine the region where the finger transitions
		from a valid touch to a "no touch" state.  This is the transition point into the dead zone.
		Note the smallest value and set the corresponding X and Y lower trim trackpad parameters to this value. 

		<BR>
		<BR>
		Perform the same procedure along the right and upper regions, note the largest value and set the corresponding X and Y upper trim trackpad
		parameters.  It may take several iterations to obtain the desired performance.
		Don't forget to click on the "Apply" button after you change any parameter.
				
		<P>
		<B>Range of Valid Values for TrackPad Trim Parameters</B>
		<BR>
		Trackpad trim values must be between 0 and  Desired_Resolution-1.
		In addition, the lower trim must be less than the upper trim.  To disable trackpad trim,
		set the lower trim to 0 and the upper trim to the Desired_Resolution.

		<B>Affected Software Parameters</B>
		
		<BR>
		The Lower_Trim X parameter corresponds to the  <i><b>ui16LowerTrim_X</b></i> member of the 
		<i><b>tTrackPadSensorParams</b></i> type in the CapTIvate Touch Library.
		
		<BR>
		The Upper_Trim X parameter corresponds to the  <i><b>ui16UpperTrim_X</b></i> member of the 
		<i><b>tTrackPadSensorParams</b></i> type in the CapTIvate Touch Library.
		
		<BR>
		The Lower_Trim Y parameter corresponds to the  <i><b>ui16LowerTrim_Y</b></i> member of the 
		<i><b>tTrackPadSensorParams</b></i> type in the CapTIvate Touch Library.
		
		<BR>
		The Upper_Trim Y parameter corresponds to the  <i><b>ui16UpperTrim_Y</b></i> member of the 
		<i><b>tTrackPadSensorParams</b></i> type in the CapTIvate Touch Library.
