		<B>Bias Current</B>
		<P>
		
		Bias current is only applicable to mutual capacitance sensors.  When measuring
		mutual capacitance sensors, a sample and hold amplifier drives the receive electrode
		to remove any contributions of the parasitic capacitance to ground.  This ensures that only
		the charge associated with the mutual capacitance is accumulated on the sample capacitor during
		the measurement.  The bias current parameter provides the ability to optimize a design for
		power consumption if the system allows for it.  
		
		<P>
		If power consumption is not a concern, the 
		bias current may be defaulted to the highest value and left alone.  
		
		<P>
		If power must be optimized,
		it is possible to begin reducing the bias current one level at a time while observing the impact
		on the measurement when touched.  If there is too much parasitic capacitance to ground,
		the achievable deltas may be reduced and the measurement may dip below the LTA due to a touch,
		rather than rise above it.  In this case, the parasitic capacitance is overwhelming the drive
		capability of the sample and hold amplifier and the bias current needs to be increased.

		<B>Implementation Notes</B>
		<BR>
		For some systems with little parasitic capacitance to ground, varying the bias current may not 
		have a large effect on performance.  When adjusting the bias current, be sure to test all
		touch use-cases to verify functionality.
