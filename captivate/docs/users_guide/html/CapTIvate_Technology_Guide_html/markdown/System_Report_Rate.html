		<B>Active Mode Scan Rate (in milliseconds)</B>
		<BR>
		The active mode scan rate specifies the period (in milliseconds) to refresh the user interface at
		when in active mode (as opposed to autonomous mode).
		To convert to samples per second (SPS), simply take 1000 divided by the specified report rate period.
		For example, a report rate (response time) of 50ms would equate to 20 samples per second (SPS).

		<B>Implementation Notes</B>
		<BR>
		This parameter specifies the desired period.  If a period is specified that is shorter than the amount
		of time required to measure and process the panel, then the system will simply run at the fastest 
		rate possible.
		<P>
		The period described here is closely tied to the overall response time of the
		system to a touch or proximity.  Shorter values for Active_Mode_Scan_rate_ms lead
		to more frequent scanning of the user interface.  This is the negative effect of increasing power consumption,
		but the net positive effect of increasing count filter and de-bounce performance by allowing the filter coefficients 
		and de-bounce thresholds to be increased without sacrificing the response of the system to a touch.

		<BR>
		
		The Active_Mode_Scan_rate_ms parameter corresponds to the
		<i><b>ui16ActiveModeScanPeriod</b></i> 
		member of the
		<i><b>tCaptivateApplication</b></i> 
		type in the CapTIvate Touch Library.
