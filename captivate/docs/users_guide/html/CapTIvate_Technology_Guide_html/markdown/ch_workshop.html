<h2>Important note about wake on proximity behavior<a class="headerlink" href="#important-note-about-wake-on-proximity-behavior" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To understand how the wake on proximity mode affects the out of box experience, the behavior is illustrated below. <img alt="Out of box status LEDs" src="../_images/evm_wot_pic1.png" /></p>
<div class="section" id="wake-on-proximity-low-power-mode">
<h3>Wake on proximity low power mode<a class="headerlink" href="#wake-on-proximity-low-power-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The MCU board may appear to not be working during wake-on-proximity mode. There is no communications with the design center and both LEDs on the MCU board will be off. In this state the CPU is in low power mode 3 with the hardware state machine actively scanning only the proximity sensor at 10Hz until a proximity event is detected. <img alt="Wake on proximity mode" src="../_images/evm_wot_pic2.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cpu-scanning-in-active-mode">
<h3>CPU scanning in active mode<a class="headerlink" href="#cpu-scanning-in-active-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Bringing your hand near the board will introduce a proximity condition causing the CPU to exit low power mode and resume actively scanning all the panel sensors at 30Hz as long as your hand is near or touching the panel. LED1 will blink at the rate the CPU is scanning the sensors. LED2 will be on while the proximity detect is true. <img alt="Active mode" src="../_images/evm_wot_pic3.png" /></p>

<div class="section" id="entering-wake-on-proximity-low-power-mode">
<h3>Entering wake on proximity low power mode<a class="headerlink" href="#entering-wake-on-proximity-low-power-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After removing your hand away from the board, LED2 led will turn off, however, LED1 will remain on, indicating the panel is still being scanned for a short period by the CPU. After one second the CPU enters low-power mode 3, LED1 turns off and the hardware state machine is now actively scanning only the proximity sensor. <img alt="Entering sleep mode" src="../_images/evm_wot_pic4.png" /></p>

</ul>
<p>The Design Center canvas displays the current state of the sensors on the touch panel. Touch the various sensors on the panel, and observe the response on the canvas. The Design Center draws circular button indicators for button groups, and shows a slider, wheel and proximity depiction for slider, wheel and proximity sensors.</p>

<p>Red on a slider or wheel sensor indicates that the slider or wheel is NOT being touched, and the needle or circle shows the last valid position. Green on a slider or wheel sensor indicates that the slider or wheel is being touched, and the needle or circle indicator shows the position. WHITE on a button group indicator or proximity sensor implies that there is no touch or proximity detection on the respective element. Green indicates that the element is being touched. Amber indicates that the element is in proximity detection. GREEN will always supersede AMBER, because when an element is in a touch detect state it is usually also in a proximity detect state. To see both the proximity detection LED and the touch detection LED at the same time, along with the raw data, let&#8217;s open the controller customizer.</p>
<p>Double click on the MSP430 widget in the canvas view. The controller customizer window will open.</p>

<p>The controller customizer window offers MCU configuration control as well as real-time viewing of element data from the entire panel at once. These different features are located on the different tabs of the customizer. The default tab for the controller customizer is the Configure Connections tab.

<p>Open the Channel Bar Chart tab. The Channel Bar Chart tab displays channel data for every element in the system. Proximity and touch indicators (Amber and Green, respectively) are shown below the bar for each channel. The channel&#8217;s immediate count value is drawn as the blue bar in the plot for each channel. The green bar indicates the touch threshold, and the yellow bar indicates the proximity threshold. The LTA is drawn as a black bar, and usually appears hidden behind the count bar unless the element is being touched.</p>

<h3>Part 1 - Creating a New Design<a class="headerlink" href="#part-1-creating-a-new-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Configuring the sensors is an important step. We want to take advantage of the target MCU&#8217;s parallel scanning capability, and to do this we need to make optimal connections between the available CapTIvate™ port pins and the electrodes in each sensor. Being able to scan electrodes in parallel can impact both the scan time and power consumption. In this section, we&#8217;ll use the CapTIvate™ Design Center&#8217;s auto-assignment feature to generate an optimal pin assignment for the CAPTIVATE-BSWP panel.</p>
<p>The BSWP (Button, Slider, Wheel and Proximity) panel features several different self-capacitance sensors: a button group, a wheel, a slider and a proximity sensor. The diagram below shows the pin assignments and sensor layout.</p>

<p>Our panel has a button group (keypad with 8 buttons), a 4-element slider, a 3-element wheel and single element proximity sensor. Let&#8217;s add a bean for each one of those sensors now. Just like the controller, the respective beans for each one of these sensor types can be added by clicking the bean icon, and dropping the bean onto the canvas. Now that we&#8217;ve added these sensors, the canvas should look similar to the image below.</p>

<h4>Configuring Sensors<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-sensors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The canvas now contains all of the sensors in our system, plus the controller. Now we need to tell the Design Center more information about each of the sensors in our system. Let&#8217;s start with the button group. Double-click the button group that we added to the canvas to open its customizer window. The customizer has a Configuration section at the top of the customizer. Since our panel is self-capacitance only, we&#8217;ll want to specify SELF for the Capacitive Mode option. We have eight buttons that make up the keypad, so we will set the button count to 8. Notice that the Electrode Configuration drop-down will only show one option: 2 Cycles, 0 Tx Pin and 8 Rx Pin, since that is the only possibility for an eight-button, self-capacitance sensor. Your customizer should match the image shown here.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id24">
<img alt="Add Sensor Beans" src="../_images/workshop_configure_sensors.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 349 </span><span class="caption-text">Add Sensor Beans</span></p>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s also give the button group a creative name. The name is entered in the Name text box at the top of the customizer. If you remember back to the demo, it was named buttonGroupSensor. Here, it&#8217;s named BTN0000, a unique default name provided by the Design Center. Let&#8217;s name it keypad for this lab.</p>
<p>The same process is required for the slider, wheel and proximity sensors. Go ahead and setup the configuration for those sensors now to match the panel configuration (refer to the image at the beginning of this section for a reference). The Design Center assumes 3 elements for a wheel and 4 elements for a slider, which is exactly the configuration we have on this board. That means all we are really doing is naming the sensors and setting the capacitive sensing mode to SELF. Don&#8217;t forget to give these sensors new names as shown in the diagram below. When you&#8217;re finished, they should look like the following three images.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id25">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 350 </span><span class="caption-text">Sensors Configured</span></p>
</div>
<p>The canvas view should now show small connection points on the left side of the four sensors: 8 for the keypad, 4 for the slider, 3 for the wheel and 1 for the proximity sensor. Each connection point indicates a CapTIvate™ port that is required for that sensor. Next, we&#8217;ll be mapping these connection points to actual ports on the MSP430FR2633 MCU that we selected to be the controller.</p>

<h4>Auto Assign Sensor Connections<a class="headerlink" href="#auto-assign-sensor-connections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As we pointed out at the beginning of this section, we are going to let the Design Center automatically map sensors to ports. This is the recommended way to map ports because the Design Center uses an algorithm to determine the most optimal configuration. Port assignment is done in the controller customizer. Open the controller customizer. This is the first bean we added- the one that looks like a device. The customizer opens with the Configure Connections tab selected, as shown below. The sensors we added in the previous step are listed in the &#8220;Unconnected Sensor Electrode&#8221; box at the far left of the tab, indicating that nothing has been connected yet. Notice that the Generate Source Code button is grayed out and unavailable. This is because a valid port mapping is required to generate source code. The middle box on the Configure Connections tab has one row for each available CapTIvate™ port. The Use Mode column of the table has each pin to &#8220;Unrestricted&#8221; by default. This means that
the Auto-Assign feature assumes it has access to all of the ports listed here. It&#8217;s possible to reserve a port (say, if you wanted to use it for a SPI interface) by changing the &#8220;Unrestricted&#8221; option to &#8220;Reserved.&#8221; The BSWP panel that we are designing now requires all 16 ports, so let&#8217;s leave all of the ports as &#8220;Unrestricted.&#8221;</p>
<div class="figure" id="id27">
<img alt="Auto Assign Feature" src="../_images/workshop_auto_assign.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 352 </span><span class="caption-text">Auto Assign Feature</span></p>
</div>
<p>When complete, you should see a configuration as shown below. Notice how the indicator is GREEN and shows OK, indicating all the sensors have been connected to controller port pins with no conflicts. Also notice that all 16 CapTIvate™ I/O pins have been used.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id28">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 353 </span><span class="caption-text">Auto Assign Successful</span></p>
</div>
<p>Now that the port mapping is known, the time cycles are calculated. The 3rd and final box on the &#8220;Configure Connections&#8221; tab shows a breakdown of the time cycles. A time cycle is a group of elements that will be measured in parallel (at the same time as each other). Notice that the keypad sensor will be measured in two time cycles, and the proximity, slider, and wheel sensor each require one time cycle each. If the device only supported sequential measurements, this panel would take 16 cycles to measure each sensor! With this device we are doing it in just 5, reducing measurement time and power consumption.</p>

<div class="section" id="part-2-tuning-sensors">
<h3>Part 2 - Tuning Sensors<a class="headerlink" href="#part-2-tuning-sensors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At this point, we have not yet specified what kind of tuning we want for each sensor. Each sensor is operating off of the default values that were assigned by the design center. These default values are good starting points, but there is room for improvement. That is the goal of Part 2- to improve upon the defaults and dial in the values that are best for this application. Let&#8217;s look at the individual element data for the 16 channels in our system. Open the Controller customizer and select the Channel Bar Chart tab. All 16 channels will be showing their element data here. While touching the various sensors, the BLUE bars (absolute count measurement) will decrease since this is a self-capacitance panel. Solid RED bars indicate the delta between the long term average (LTA) and the current count. These will increase when an element is touched. Note the position of the default thresholds relative to the counts as you interact with the panel.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id33">
<img alt="Channel Bar View" src="../_images/workshop_tune_channel_bar.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 358 </span><span class="caption-text">Channel Bar View</span></p>
</div>
<p>The design center assigns default proximity and touch thresholds for all sensors. These values will have to be fine-tuned for each element, since each element has a slightly different sensitivity and parasitic capacitance. You can examine these defaults by opening the CAPT_UserConfig.c file in CCS. Search for &#8221;.ui8TouchThreshold&#8221; or &#8221;.ui16ProxThreshold.&#8221; Notice that proximity threshold is assigned to the sensor while touch thresholds are assigned to each individual element in the sensor.</p>
<p>Note: the proximity threshold value is an absolute deviation from the LTA (long term average) whereas the touch threshold value is dynamic, expressed as a percentage of the LTA. To learn more, double click on a sensor, click on the Tuning Tab, then on the Proximity Threshold or Touch Threshold Parameters to bring up the integrated help topics.</p>
<p>Tuning is done on a sensor-by-sensor basis. Each sensor has a customizer window that is opened by double-clicking the sensor bean on the canvas.</p>
<div class="section" id="tuning-a-button-group-sensor">
<h4>Tuning a Button Group Sensor<a class="headerlink" href="#tuning-a-button-group-sensor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the button group sensor first.</p>
<p>TIP: To assist us in the sensor tuning process, any one of the sensor&#8217;s tabs can be &#8220;un-docked&#8221; allowing us to view the real time data in one tab while modifying a tuning parameter in another tab.</p>

<h5>Conversion Count and Conversion Gain<a class="headerlink" href="#conversion-count-and-conversion-gain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Let&#8217;s experiment with Conversion Count and Conversion Gain. Close the controller customizer, and open the keypad sensor customizer by double clicking the keypad sensor on the canvas. In the customizer, we can see the same bar chart as we saw in the controller view, but here we only see 8 bars for the 8 elements in the keypad sensor. Touch button #1 on the panel while viewing the data in the Design Center. Notice that a touch produces around 75 counts of delta in the measurement - it goes from ~500 counts (also the default conversion count specification), down to ~425 when touched.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id35">
<img alt="Close up Button Bar" src="../_images/workshop_tune_gain_count.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 360 </span><span class="caption-text">Close up Button Bar</span></p>
</div>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to have 75 counts of delta, but do we really need that much information to determine a touch condition? The system is quite stable (only a few counts of noise), so the extra resolution isn&#8217;t really necessary, and it comes at the cost of scan time and power consumption, which we will investigate in a later lab. Let&#8217;s see if we can still get enough information out of the sensor to determine a touch condition if we bring the conversion count to 250, instead of the default 500.</p>
<p>Open the Conversion Control tab in the button sensor customizer.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id36">
<img alt="Conversion Control" src="../_images/workshop_tune_conversion_control.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 361 </span><span class="caption-text">Conversion Control</span></p>
</div>
<p>If you did not change any of the default settings, your conversion control window should look like the one above. The Design Center has selected a Conversion Count of 500, and a Conversion Gain of 250. We&#8217;ve shown that this provides the adequate information we need to determine a touch, but let&#8217;s dial the numbers back a bit. Let&#8217;s try 250 for Conversion Count and 100 for Conversion Gain. Note that Conversion Gain is the &#8220;base&#8221; value that the MCU will try to achieve without using parasitic capacitance offset subtraction. The overall Conversion Count is the count we are trying to achieve after we&#8217;ve added offset subtraction.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id37">
<img alt="Conversion Control" src="../_images/workshop_tune_conversion_control2.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 362 </span><span class="caption-text">Conversion Control</span></p>
</div>
<p>After a tuning parameter is adjusted in the Design Center, the Apply button lights up yellow, reminding you that you have parameter changes that need to be applied to the target microcontroller. Let&#8217;s press the Apply button now to submit the changes. Switching back to the Channel Bar Chart tab, the changes should be immediately visible. The baseline (no touch) measurement is now normalized at ~250 counts, and touching the button should decrease the counts to ~200, providing a delta of ~45-50 counts.</p>

<h5>Proximity and Touch Thresholds<a class="headerlink" href="#proximity-and-touch-thresholds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve got an appropriate measurement resolution, let&#8217;s adjust the proximity threshold and touch threshold to appropriate values that provide the desired feel for the button. While pressing button #1 on the panel, look at the bar graph you will see the green bar represents the location of the touch threshold and the amber bar represents the proximity threshold. Since our blue bar (current count) is past both the proximity threshold (amber) and the touch threshold (green), both the proximity and touch light is illuminated.</p>
<p>Since a full touch provides ~50 counts of delta, the default touch threshold makes the element a little too sensitive. We require a firm touch that is centered on the button. Let&#8217;s edit the touch threshold to require a firmer touch.</p>
<p>The touch threshold defines the size of the delta on a given element that is required for that element to enter a touch state. Touch thresholds are specified as a percentage of the long term average (LTA). Because of this, the actual absolute value is calculated dynamically at runtime. In the Design Center, they are entered in units of 1/128 the long term average (LTA). By specifying touch thresholds as a percentage of the LTA, the threshold is kept proportional to the LTA even as the LTA drifts. The default touch threshold value is 10. Since we specified a conversion count of 250, our effective touch threshold is now 250/128 * 10, or 19. Viewing the touch threshold in the Channel Table now shows the absolute threshold = 231, or 250-19.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id39">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 364 </span><span class="caption-text">Proximity and Touch Thresholds</span></p>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s increase the touch threshold to 15 for this system. A touch threshold of 15 would provide an effective touch threshold of 250/128 * 15, or 29. This will require a firmer touch for a touch to be declared. The touch threshold is set in the Tuning tab of the sensor customizer, just like the Conversion Count and Conversion Gain. Since the keypad is made up of 8 elements numbered from E00 to E07, button #1 corresponds to electrode E00 (CH8), so we want to modify the touch threshold for all 8 elements (E00 to E07). These changes improve the feel of the buttons.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to understand more about how touch thresholds work, read the Description box in the Design Center when editing one. Feel free to adjust the proximity threshold. Note that there is only one proximity threshold. This threshold applies to the entire sensor.</p>

<div class="section" id="count-filtering">
<h5>Count Filtering<a class="headerlink" href="#count-filtering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>When looking at the bar graph, it&#8217;s easy to see that the count value drops 50 counts almost instantly when the button is touched. Let&#8217;s adjust the count filter to be more aggressive. In the Tuning tab, set the count filter beta value to 2 (the default is 1). This means that we will have a 25% weight for each new value, as opposed to a 50% weight- so the sensor should respond twice as slow. We might also see a little bit less noise on the system due to the increase in the filter.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id40">
<img alt="Count Filters" src="../_images/workshop_tune_count_filter.png" />

</div>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to hit Apply after you&#8217;ve made the change. Now, looking at the bar graph, the system should show a slightly slower response. One neat way to look at filter responses is the Channel Oscilloscope Plot tab. This is an alternative view to the bar chart that shows history, and it&#8217;s a nice way to look at responses to filter changes.</p>
<p>You may notice that there is a count filter beta value as well as a LTA filter beta value. The LTA filter beta value effects how fast the long-term-average (LTA) tracks changes in the base count when no one is touching the panel (no threshold crossings). The default filter beta for the long term average filter is 7. The available options for both the count filter beta and LTA filter beta are 0 through 7. The filter doubles in strength with each increase. As we&#8217;ve seen, moving from 1 to 2 doubles the response of the filter to a step input.</p>

<h5>Wheel Conversion Count and Conversion Gain<a class="headerlink" href="#wheel-conversion-count-and-conversion-gain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The wheel sensor also has a default Conversion Count of 500, with a Conversion Gain of 250. You should see about 100 counts of delta as you run your finger across the wheel. Unlike the buttons that we tuned previously, the wheel uses each element&#8217;s delta as an input to a position function to calculate where you are touching on the wheel. Thus, here it is beneficial to increase the conversion count to provide additional resolution. Let&#8217;s set the Conversion Count to 800 and the Conversion Gain to 125.</p>

<h5>Wheel Resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#wheel-resolution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The default wheel position resolution is 1000 points, providing 0 to 999 positions. Most applications won&#8217;t need this much resolution, so let&#8217;s reduce it to a more usable value of 100. Change the desired resolution tuning parameter to 100 from the default of 1000. After applying the change, notice how the response of the wheel is still just as linear as it was at 1000 counts, but now the data is actually much more usable, since it&#8217;s easy to dial in any specific number. The algorithm supports up to 16 bits of resolution.</p>

<h5>Wheel Sensor Position Filtering<a class="headerlink" href="#wheel-sensor-position-filtering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The other knob we to play with is the position filter coefficient. The sensor filter can be adjusted in 255 different steps. 255 would represent a unity response (no filtering), and 1 would represent the strongest filter. Let&#8217;s pick up the response time of the wheel even more by changing the wheel filter coefficient to 150 from the default of 100. The wheel response should be quite fast now, and there should still be enough filtering to provide a stable position report with little jitter. For fun, set the sensor filter to 25 and see how the wheel responds to over-filtering.</p>

Notice that if you hold a finger hovering over the wheel, the elements enter a touch state well before you actually touch on the panel.

<p>The slider is very similar to the wheel- with the exception that it&#8217;s chopped and has two endpoints. All of the same principles apply, but there will be two new parameters: Slider Lower Trim, and Slider Upper Trim.</p>
<p>Select the Tuning tab in the customizer. The Upper Trim and Lower Trim parameters are the last two parameters in the parameter window so use the scroll bar to view them.</p>

</div>
<p>While moving your finger up and down the slider, you may notice that the slider values only seem to go from about 40 up to 960, even though we&#8217;ve stated we want a resolution of 1000 (0 to 999 positions) for this sensor. The reason we never get to 0 or 999 is because we&#8217;ve essentially taken a wheel and cut it in half- and the end points never get &#8220;pulled&#8221; by their opposite elements. To counteract this, there is a mechanism to stretch the slider by trimming the edges. Currently, the lower trim value is set to 0, and the upper trim value is set to 999. This means that there is no stretching being applied. We can apply stretching by providing trim values to the slider to re-align our zero point and max point. To set the slider trim values, place your finger on the left-most part of the slider, and look at the response. It will likely be somewhere above zero, but less than 100. We want that position to be defined as zero, so that the user can fully get to 0 when using the slider. Whatever
measurement you get when touching the left-most part of the slider, enter that in the Lower Trim parameter box in the Tuning tab. Then, place your finger in the right-most part of the slider. You will likely see a value between 900 and 999 (since we are going out to 1000 points of resolution). Whatever measurement you see, place that in the Upper Trim parameter box. Then Apply the changes to the controller, and review the results. For this slider, the values below work well with the other settings that have been specified.</p>

<h5>About Re-purposing the Touch Threshold<a class="headerlink" href="#about-re-purposing-the-touch-threshold" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Since we are using the proximity threshold to know when someone is close to the panel, we could repurpose the touch threshold for another task. Since the proximity sensor layout on the CAPTIVATE-BSWP panel travels around the PCB, it could be used to detect if someone was leaning up against the panel, or putting their whole hand down on top of it. This kind of information could be used to block outputs of other keys. Imagine a security keypad application that is mounted on a wall. If someone leans up against it, it would be nice if we could detect that and prevent all of the other sensors from triggering at the same time. The touch threshold could be set to detect this kind of a scenario, while the proximity threshold is used to detect distance.</p>

<div class="section" id="miscellaneous-sensor-parameters">
<h4>Miscellaneous Sensor Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#miscellaneous-sensor-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s briefly re-visit a few generic sensor parameters that we have not yet addressed. The first is the sensor timeout threshold.</p>
<p>Sensor Timeout</p>
<p>The sensor timeout threshold provides a mechanism for averting a &#8220;stuck key&#8221; scenario. Imagine a touch panel on thermostat on a wall. Let&#8217;s say someone put a broom stick up against thermostat, and that showed up as a proximity detection. A proximity detection has the effect of halting our long-term-average. This means that the LTA is no longer going to track environmental drift. This affects the usability of the touch panel. The timeout feature allows for this to be averted by specifying, in samples, how long a sensor can be in detect (proximity or touch) before the interaction is declared invalid.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id49">
<img alt="Selecting Slider Timeout Value" src="../_images/workshop_tune_sensor_timeout.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 374 </span><span class="caption-text">Selecting Slider Timeout Value</span></p>
</div>
<p>Typically when users are using sensors, they touch them briefly- not for 30 seconds or more. By setting a lower sensor timeout threshold, we can have the system &#8220;reset&#8221; if for some reason it is stuck in detect for a long time. We can simulate this tool by setting the timeout extremely short- say, 200 samples. After 200 samples in detect (&lt; 10sec), the system will reset the touch flags and reseed the long term average. Feel free to try this out.</p>
<p>Sensor De-Bounce</p>
<p>The touch library offers a built-in de-bounce mechanism for into and out of proximity and touch states. This is adjustable at a sensor level.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id50">
<img alt="Selecting Slider Debounce Values" src="../_images/workshop_tune_sensor_debounce.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 375 </span><span class="caption-text">Selecting Slider Debounce Values</span></p>
</div>
<p>Default settings for De-Bounce is 0 (no de-bounce applied). By applying de-bounce to the system, you offer a way to ensure that there was actually a valid touch (and not a brush of a hand or a noise event). However, de-bounce introduces latency into the system.</p>
<p>Try out setting longer and longer de-bounce settings and observing the effects on the sensor performance.</p>

<h3>Part 1 - Measure Proximity Sensor Low Power current<a class="headerlink" href="#part-1-measure-proximity-sensor-low-power-current" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>First, let&#8217;s measure the wake on proximity average current to establish a baseline. Be sure to keep your hands clear of the PCB while performing this measurement. The EnergyTrace™ &#8220;mean&#8221; current measurement should &lt; 10uA. This is the current required to measure the proximity sensor &#64; 10 times per second using the default conversion count of 800. If your measurement is much greater than 10uA, hit the RESET button, wait for LED2 to blink once then repeat the measurement. If the measurement is 0, make sure you have jumper J3 between MCU_VCC and 3.3V METERED on the MCU PCB. Record your measurement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="part-2-effects-of-sensor-sensitivity-on-low-power-current">
<h3>Part 2 - Effects of Sensor Sensitivity on Low Power current<a class="headerlink" href="#part-2-effects-of-sensor-sensitivity-on-low-power-current" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Next we want to measure the effects a sensor&#8217;s tuning can have on the device&#8217;s current consumption. The BSWP demo board has a single element proximity sensor that runs the perimeter of the PCB. This proximity sensor is used by the &#8220;wake on proximity&#8221; state machine to detect when a hand is near the PCB. The proximity sensor is tuned just a like a button, but with greater sensitivity. In LAB1, the proximity conversion count was set to 800, providing sufficient resolution and proximity detection out to a couple of centimeters. Let&#8217;s see if we can increase the distance by increasing the resolution of the sensor.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id63">
<img alt="BSWP Proximity Traces" src="../_images/workshop_lab2_bswp_traces.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 388 </span><span class="caption-text">BSWP Proximity Traces</span></p>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by increasing the conversion count to 1600. In the Design Center, double-click the proximity sensor to open its customizer, then click the Conversion Control tab. Update the conversion count to 1600, then click the <em>Apply</em> button. Click on the Channel Bar Chart to view the new conversion count data and confirm the LTA is near 1600. Verify as your hand approaches the PCB, the proximity detection now occurs sooner (further from the PCB). The proximity sensor is now more sensitive and able to detect proximity from a greater distance. If you are having trouble seeing the values at 1600, it may be necessary to adjust the plot range in order to see the channel bar data. Adjust the plot parameters to fit the new size of the channel bar using the Plot Display Options.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id64">
<img alt="Plot options" src="../_images/workshop_lab2_plot_options.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 389 </span><span class="caption-text">Plot options</span></p>
</div>
<p>You may also notice with this higher resolution it may be more difficult to see the when the blue bar crosses the proximity thresholds. The design center has a &#8220;zoom&#8221; feature allowing an expanded view of the selected area.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id65">
<img alt="Zoom in" src="../_images/workshop_lab2_zoom_in.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 390 </span><span class="caption-text">Zoom in</span></p>
</div>
<p>Now that we have increased the sensitivity, let&#8217;s change the proximity threshold to prevent false detections. Select the Proximity sensor&#8217;s Tuning tab and modify the sensor&#8217;s Proximity Threshold and Negative Touch threshold to 30. Click on the Negative Touch parameter for additional information about this parameter in the Design Center description frame.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id66">
<img alt="Proximity Thresholds" src="../_images/workshop_lab2_proximity_threshold.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 391 </span><span class="caption-text">Proximity Thresholds</span></p>
</div>
<p>With the increase in sensitivity, we have effectively increased our proximity range. Let&#8217;s see how this impacts our low-power current. <strong>DO NOT</strong> reset the MCU, as this will cause the conversion count reset to 800 and thresholds to reset to 15. Start EnergyTrace™ and examine the &#8220;mean&#8221; current. It should be about double from the previous baseline measurement. Record your measurement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="part-3-effects-of-sensor-scan-rate-on-low-power-current">
<h3>Part 3 - Effects of Sensor Scan Rate on Low Power current<a class="headerlink" href="#part-3-effects-of-sensor-scan-rate-on-low-power-current" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The device&#8217;s low power current can also be affected by the rate at which a sensor is scanned. Let&#8217;s reset everything back to default by pressing the MCU reset button. To confirm the parameters were reset to their original programmed values, click the proximity sensor Conversion control tab, then the READ button. This reads the current values in the target MCU and you should see the conversion count = 800. In the Design Center, double-click the controller to open its customizer and select the Conversion Control tab. Modify the Wake On Proximity Mode Scan Rate to 50ms then click Apply. This effectively doubles the rate we scan the proximity sensor. <img alt="Proximity Scan Rate" src="../_images/workshop_lab2_scan_rate.png" /></p>
<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> reset the MCU, as this will reset the scan rate to 100. Start EnergyTrace™ and examine the &#8220;mean&#8221; current. Again, you should see the current more than double from the baseline measurement.</p>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The demand for higher sensitivity, higher resolution sensing has a direct impact on the low-power current, as does the rate at which a sensor is scanned. So always consider the trade-offs when designing your sensors for the end application.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You have successfully experimented with the low-power &#8220;wake on proximity&#8221; feature and learned how sensor tuning and scan rate can directly impact your sensor design.

<h3>Part 1 - CapTIvate™ Touch Library Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#part-1-captivate-touch-library-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For this portion of the lab you are encouraged to follow along as we explore the CapTIvate™ capacitive touch library.</p>
<p>The software library is a comprehensive collection of functions or components for touch, communications and sensor management as represented by the software stack shown below. The primary &#8220;Touch&#8221; layers are Advanced, Touch (or &#8220;Base&#8221;) and Communications. Functions range from advanced sensor processing to &#8220;bare-metal&#8221; functions allowing direct access to the CapTIvate™ peripheral.</p>
<p>Communication functions for I2C and UART serial drivers and a communications protocol enable the MSP430FR26xx\25xx microcontroller to send sensor data to the CapTIvate™ Design Center during the sensor development process.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 395 </span><span class="caption-text">Slider callback extra credit</span></p>
</div>
<p>The majority of library components are provided pre-compiled in the MSP430FR2633 ROM. They are also provided as captivate .lib or captivate.r43 file format for CCS and IAR respectively. No source code is provided for these components. These components are accessed using the <a class="reference external" href="../../api_guide/FR2633/html/index.html">CapTIvate™ API</a></p>

<p>Other components are provided as source code that can be modified to suit the needs of the application. The library manager is one example. The library manager &#8220;CAPT_Manager.c&#8221;provides three high-level functions to manage the primary sensor activities; CAPT_initUI(), CAPT_updateUI() and CAPT_calibrateUI(). This greatly simplifies the application&#8217;s interface with the library and can be used a framework for your application. The library manager is provided as source.</p>

<h3>Part 3 - Creating and using callbacks<a class="headerlink" href="#part-3-creating-and-using-callbacks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The CapTIvate™ touch library uses callbacks to communicate with the user&#8217;s application. Callbacks provide a mechanism for the application to be notified when a sensor has been updated. The application must first register its &#8220;callback&#8221; function for each sensor before it can receive updates. Once an application&#8217;s callback function is registered, the callback is executed each time the corresponding sensor is scanned and processed, regardless if a proximity or touch detection has occurred. During the callback, the application can query the sensor&#8217;s data structure to determine the status of the sensor. The illustration below shows an example sequence where the keypad is scanned and processed, then the keypad callback is executed, followed by sensor data and status communicated to the CapTIvate™ Design Center. This sequence continues for the other sensors then repeats based on the programmed scan rate.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id73">
<img alt="Callback after sensor processing" src="../_images/workshop_lab3_callback_slot.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 398 </span><span class="caption-text">Callback after sensor processing</span></p>
</div>
<p>For this lab we are going to create a callback function that will turn on LED1 when any keypad button is pressed. The library function <em>CAPT_registerCallback()</em> provides the callback registration.</p>
<p>Registering the application&#8217;s callback function named &#8220;my_keypad_callback&#8221; to a keypad sensor uses the following syntax:</p>
<p><strong>MAP_CAPT_registerCallback(&amp;keypad, &amp;my_keypad_callback);</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="lab3-action">
<h4>LAB3 Action:<a class="headerlink" href="#lab3-action" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In our LAB3 code project, insert the function call described above just before the function call CAPT_appStart(), around line 80, in main. This will allow our callback to be registered before the library starts.</p>
<p>Note: The names of the sensors created by the design center for our project are located in the CAPT_UserConfig.h file and shown here for convenience. You can see the first sensor in this list is our keypad sensor.</p>

</div>
<p>Next, inside our callback, the application can perform any processing on the sensor data and status, such as checking for proximity, touch detection or slider/wheel position. Here is our example that checks when any button in the keypad is touched and released, toggling an LED accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id6">

<p>Then, in our callback we will turn on LED2 only when a &#8220;touch&#8221; is first detected, and turn off LED2 when a release is detected. This minimizes the time the CPU spends in the callback.

<h3>Part 4 - Determining sensor state and position<a class="headerlink" href="#part-4-determining-sensor-state-and-position" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sliders and wheels are multi-element sensors, typically with 3 or more electrodes. Like buttons, sliders and wheels can have proximity and touch states, but they also have a position. Position is determined from the individual element measurements. The CapTIvate™ software library&#8217;s algorithm determines the sensors position (place where finger is touching) based on the measurements from all the sensor&#8217;s elements and provides the result in the sensor&#8217;s structure.</p>
<p>In this section we are going to create a callback function for the slider that will turn on LED1 when the slider&#8217;s position is greater than 500 and turn off LED when the position is less than or equal to 500. We chose 500 because from LAB1 the slider&#8217;s resolution was set to 1000, which provides points from 0 to 999.</p>
<p>Registering the application&#8217;s callback function named &#8220;my_slider_callback&#8221; to a slider sensor uses the following syntax:</p>

<p>Click the debugger icon to build and download the code to the target. Click the &#8220;play&#8221; icon to start the demo running.</p>
<p>While viewing the slider in the design center, LED1 will turn on when your finger is greater than 500 and turn off below 500. What happens when you release your finger from the slider when greater than 500? LED1 remains on. That&#8217;s because our code only changes the state of the led when the slider is being pressed.</p>
<p>What modifications to this callback will turn off LED1 if the slider is not being touched?</p>
<p>Here is one answer below. Try it to see if it works:</p>
