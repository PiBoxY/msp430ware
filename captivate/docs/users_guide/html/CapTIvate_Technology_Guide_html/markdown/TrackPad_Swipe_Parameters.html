        <B>Swipe Time Maximum Threshold</B>
		<P>
        The swipe time threshold sets the maximum time (#samples) between the finger touch 
		and finger release before it can be considered as a valid swipe. If the duration is too long
		(finger stays in contact with surface beyond Swipe Duration Threshold) the gesture is considered
		a tracking motion and is ignored.

		<B>Swipe Distance Minimum Threshold</B>
        <P>
        The swipe distance threshold sets the minimum distance (measured points) a finger must travel
		before it can be considered for a valid swipe.  If the distance traveled is too short, the
		gesture is ignored.  Note: if the sensor's resolution is changed, this Swipe Distance Threshold
		should be re-scaled accordingly.

        <B>Implementation Notes</B>
        <P>
        As an example, let's say we have a TrackPad with a resolution of 1000 points = 100 points per cm.
		If we want a minimum swipe distance to be 2cm (anything smaller is ignored), then set the
		Swipe Distance Threshold = 200 points.
        <BR>
		<BR>
		Next, we want the swipe gesture to respond to quick swipe motions (a swipe less than 0.5 seconds)
		and ignore swipe motions that are longer than 0.5 seconds.  In this example our sensor is measured
		every 10ms (100Hz), so we set the Swipe Time Maximum Threshold = 500ms/10ms = 50.
		In order for the swipe gesture to be valid, both Swipe Duration and Swipe Distance thresholds must be met.
		You can experiment with different duration and distance values to get the best feel for the size of your sensor.
