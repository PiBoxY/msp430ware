		<B>Sample Capacitor Discharge</B>
		<P>
		
		The sample capacitor discharge parameter controls whether the sample capacitor is discharged to 0V (empty) or 0.5V (half full).
		A measurement, or "conversion," is achieved by charging the external capacitor being measured and transferring that charge into an
		internal sample capacitor multiple times until the internal sample capacitor is full.  Having the sample capacitor on-chip reduces
		the overall system cost.  However, on-chip capacitors are not linear when close to empty.  By filling the sample capacitor from
		half full to full, rather than empty to full, a more stable measurement is achievable.  The trade-off is that the effective size of the
		sample capacitor is divided in half.  In the case of a very large electrode with a large amount of parasitic capacitance, it is possible
		to configure the sample capacitor to discharge to 0V rather than 0.5V to increase the sensing range of the system.

		<B>Implementation Notes</B>
		<BR>
		Sample capacitor discharge should be set to 0.5V (half full) for the majority of applications.  Only when the extra range is needed
		for handling large external capacitors should the sample capacitor be discharged fully to 0V.
