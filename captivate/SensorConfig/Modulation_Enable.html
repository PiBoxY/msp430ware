		<B>Oscillator Modulation Enable</B>
		<P>
		
		The CapTIvate peripheral oscillator incorporates a spread-spectrum clocking feature for reducing
		electromagnetic radiation.  When modulation is enabled, the CapTIvate oscillator will dither clock edges,
		spreading out clock energy across a wider frequency band.  This has an effect on emissions as well
		as susceptibility.

		<B>Implementation Notes</B>
		<BR>
		If nearby systems are effected by the capacitive touch signals being driven by the CapTIvate peripheral,
		enabling modulation will reduce the peak radiated energy by spreading out the energy any may help improve
		electromagnetic compatibility.
		
		For self-capacitance designs the require noise immunity, modulation should be enabled.
		For mutual-capacitance designs that require noise immunity, modulation should be disabled.

		The Modulation_Enable parameter corresponds to the
		<i><b>bModEnable</b></i> 
		member of the
		<i><b>tSensor</b></i> 
		type in the CapTIvate Touch Library.
