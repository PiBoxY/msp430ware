		<B>Desired Resolution</B>
		<P>
		
		The desired resolution parameter specifies the resolution of the position that is calculated
		by the slider and wheel processing algorithm.  Slider and wheel sensors are one-dimensional sensors
		that report back a position as their output.  When selecting a resolution, the value reported back for the position
		will be in the range of 0 to resolution-1.  For example, if a resolution of 100 is selected, the values will range from
		0 to 99 (100 total points of interest).

		<B>Implementation Notes</B>
		<BR>
		While resolutions up to 16-bit are supported by the algorithm, most realistic use cases involve 8-bit resolution (256 points
		of interest along the slider or wheel).

		<B>Range of Valid Values for the Desired Resolution Parameter</B>
		<BR>
		The desired resolution may be set from 3 to 65535.
