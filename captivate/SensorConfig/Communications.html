		<B>Target Communications Configuration</B>
		<P>
		The CapTIvate touch library communications module has the capability of
	    sending element data and sensor data to the host PC.  Element data consists
		of all the low level data for a sensor's elements: current measurement count,
		long term average, and touch and proximity status.  Sensor data consists of
		aggregate data for the sensor.  This includes items such as slider position,
		wheel position, and global sensor status flags.
		
		<P>
		Both data types can be sent, as well as one or the other or none.  On larger panels,
		it may be desirable to disable transmission of element data to increase the maximum
		report rate.
	
		<P>
		<B>Implementation Notes</B>
		<BR>
		The protocol used to communicate between the target Captivate MCU and the PC running
		the CapTIvate Design Center is re-usable for communicating between the target and another
		embedded host processor or host MCU.
