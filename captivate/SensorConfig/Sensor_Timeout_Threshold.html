		<B>Sensor Time-Out Threshold</B>
		<P>
		
		The sensor time-out threshold specifies a maximum amount of time a 
		sensor may be in a touch or proximity state before it is
		reset.  The threshold is set in units of samples.  The threshold 
		can be related to a time-out period in seconds by using 
		the formula below, where <I>Report Rate</I> represents 
		the measurement frequency of the sensor (in Hz).

		The sensor time-out feature is useful for restoring the system 
		in the event that a sensor gets stuck in proximity or touch detect.  
		This may happen for a variety of reasons.
		<P>
		Here are a few examples:
		<P>
		1. A proximity sensor is included in a wall-mounted thermostat to detect when someone is
		approaching the thermostat touch panel.  Someone decides to hang a picture above the thermostat
		on the wall, increasing the capacitance and causing the proximity sensor to get stuck in detect.
		If the sensor time-out feature was applied, after a period of time the proximity sensor would
		reset, clearing the proximity state and resetting the long-term-average to the new environment
		with the picture on the wall.
		<P>
		2. A phone keypad utilized capacitive touch buttons.  
		A user sets a stack of paper on top of all the
		buttons, causing them to go into a touch state.  
		After the time-out period expires, the touch state is cleared.
		When the papers are removed, the long-term-average quickly adjusts 
		to the new value, since it appears as a change
		against the direction of interest (a negative touch).
		<P>
		<B>Implementation Notes</B>
		<BR>
		The best time-out threshold depends on the application.  
		Buttons typically are not pressed for large lengths of time,
		and the time-out periods can be shorter.  
		Slider and wheel controls may be in a touch or proximity state for an extended
		period of time by design, and as such they may require longer time-out periods.
		<P>
		If you are designing a system and the counts being read back are jumping unexpectedly
		when they are touched for a long period of time, be sure to check the sensor time-out value
		to ensure it is not too short.  Note that the system report rate effects the actual
		length of time in seconds necessary for a time-out to be issued.

		<P>
		<B>Range of Valid Values for the Sensor Timeout Threshold Parameter</B>
		<BR>
		The sensor timeout threshold may be set from 0 to 65534 samples.  Note that
		specifying a value of zero would result in a sensor that times out every sample,
		which is not a useful configuration.
		
		Setting a value of 65535 disables the timeout feature altogether.
		
		<P>
		<B>Affected Software Parameters</B>
		<BR>
		
		The Sensor_Timeout_Threshold parameter corresponds to the
		<i><b>ui16TimeoutThreshold</b></i> 
		member of the
		<i><b>tSensor</b></i> 
		type in the CapTIvate Touch Library.
