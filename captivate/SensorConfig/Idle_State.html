		<B>Pin Idle State</B>
		<P>
		
		The idle state specifies the drive state of a sensor's pins when the sensor is not actively
		being measured.  Pins have the option of being driven low to ground (VSS), or left tri-stated (high-impedance).

		<B>Implementation Notes</B>
		<BR>
		For most applications, pins should be grounded when not being measured.  This is important especially if there are
		other sensors in the system.  When sensor pins (and their connected electrodes) are left floating,
		they can capacitively couple with the electrodes of nearby sensors while those sensors are being measured.  
		This can cause cross-triggering.  For some applications it is desirable to float pins (set to High-Z)when not being measured to prevent
		coupling to ground.  Water and moisture suppression would be an example of such a use case.
