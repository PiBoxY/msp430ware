		<B>Error Threshold</B>
		<P>
		The error threshold specifies the maximum conversion result allowed for any element within a sensor.
		Error threshold crossings are detected in hardware.  If during the conversion process one or more elements
		does not complete their conversion before the conversion result crosses the error threshold, the peripheral will
		terminate the conversion and the error condition will be flagged in software at a sensor level.
		This mechanism prevents a conversion from continuing forever in the event of an incorrect calibration or a hardware problem.
		Hardware problems may include, but are not limited to, a disconnected electrode or a shorted electrode.  
		The figure below illustrates an error threshold crossing.  Note that the conversion result never exceeds the error threshold, as the
		CapTIvate peripheral stops the conversion upon crossing of the error threshold.  Unlike other thresholds, the error threshold is an absolute threshold,
		and is not relative to the LTA.

		<B>Implementation Notes</B>
		<BR>
		Conversion results are 13-bit values.  As such, the maximum conversion result as well as the maximum error threshold is 8191.  This is 
		the default error threshold, and is fine for most applications.  However, the error threshold may be reduced here if desired.  
		Lowering the error threshold limits how long the peripheral may continue trying to complete the conversion.  It is up to the application to determine
		how to handle an error condition in software.  Several steps may be taken to determine why the error condition occurred, such as a re-calibration or a 
		self-test.
		
		<P>
		<B>Range of Valid Values for the Error Threshold Parameter</B>
		<BR>
		The error threshold may be set from 0 to 8191.  Conversions are limited in hardware to a maximum result of 8191.

		<B>Affected Software Parameters</B>
		<BR>
		The Error_Threshold parameter corresponds to the
		<i><b>ui16ErrorThreshold</b></i> 
		member of the
		<i><b>tSensor</b></i>
		type in the CapTIvate Touch Library.
		
		<BR>
		If an error condition occurs at runtime, the
		<i><b>bMaxCountError</b></i> 
		member of the affected
		<i><b>tSensor</b></i>
		instance will be set to alert the application that there was an error in the conversion.
