        <B>Proximity Threshold</B>
        <P>
        
        The proximity threshold sets the level of interaction required by the user 
        for a proximity detection to be declared for an element.  The proximity threshold
        is set as an absolute deviation from the long term average. In other words, it specifies
        how large the delta must be in the direction of interest for a 
        proximity state to be declared.

        <B>Self Capacitance Example</B>
        <BR>
        When measuring an element in self-capacitance mode, a user's touch on or
        proximity to the element's electrode causes the capacitance of that electrode
        to increase.  This causes a decrease in the measurement result.  When a decrease 
        in the measurement surpasses the proximity threshold, the proximity flag is set.

        <B>Mutual Capacitance Example</B>
        <BR>
        In mutual-capacitance mode, a user's touch on or proximity to an element's
        electrode causes the mutual capacitance between the Rx and Tx to decrease.
        This causes an increase in the measurement result.  When an increase in the measurement
        surpasses the proximity threshold, the proximity flag is set.

        <B>Implementation Notes</B>
        <BR>
        One proximity threshold is set and used
        for a whole sensor.  This means that you only need to set one proximity threshold
        per sensor, and all elements underneath that sensor will use that threshold.
        While only one threshold is set, each element still tracks and shows it's proximity
        status independently.  Note that the proximity detect flag is also dependent upon the de-bounce process.  
        If de-bounce is used, the proximity status flag will not be set immediately after the threshold crossing.  
        A global sensor proximity flag is made available at the sensor level.  A proximity detect on any element 
        will cause the sensor's global proximity detect flag to be set.

        <B>Range of Valid Values for the Proximity Threshold Parameter</B>

        The proximity threshold may be set from 1 to 8191.

        The Prox_Threshold parameter corresponds to the
        <i><b>ui16ProxThreshold</b></i> 
        member of the
        <i><b>tSensor</b></i> 
        type in the CapTIvate Touch Library.
        
        <BR>
        If a prox detect occurs at runtime, the 
        <i><b>bSensorProx</b></i> 
        member of the related
        <i><b>tSensor</b></i> 
        instance will be set to true, alerting the application that an element
        on that sensor entered a prox state.
        
        <BR>
        In addition, the 
        <i><b>bProx</b></i> 
        member of the related
        <i><b>tElement</b></i> 
        instance will also be set to true, allowing the application to determine
        which specific element(s) entered into a prox state.
