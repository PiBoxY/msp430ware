		<B>Calibration Algorithm</B><BR>
		
        <P>The CapTIvate Software Library offers two calibration algorithms: standard and max offset.  The default option is standard calibration, which is recommended for most applications.  The default option limits the amount of parasitic offset subtraction that can be applied.  This provides a lower temperature drift coefficient while still providing good sensitivity and average scan times.
        
        <P>The max offset option utilizes more parasitic offset subtraction than the default option, which can improve sensitivity to touch and allow lower conversion count settings to be used to achieve the same touch sensitivity (thus allowing for lower scan times).  The tradeoff is that the temperature drift coefficient is higher than the standard calibration algorithm.  Use this algorithm if you are in a temperature stable environment and require shorter measurement times.
        
        <P>For details on the behavior and implementation of these two algorithms, see the Calibration section of the Software Library chapter in the CapTIvate Technology Guide.
