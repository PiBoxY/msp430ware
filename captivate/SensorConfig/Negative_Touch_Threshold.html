		<B>Negative Touch Threshold</B>
		<P>
		
		The negative touch threshold provides a mechanism for detecting when an element's measurement 
		count adjusts quickly in the direction opposite of a touch.  This scenario might happen during
		device power-up if a user has their hand covering an electrode during power-up calibration.  The library
		makes the assumption at power-up that there is no user interaction.  This may not always be the case.  If 
		the system is calibrated with a user touching a sensor, when they remove their hand, the measurements from that
		sensor's elements will quickly adjust in the opposite direction of a touch.  Setting a negative touch threshold provides
		a way to quickly detect this event.  Upon detection, the application may want to re-calibrate to ensure 
		full sensitivity from the electrode immediately following the "negative" touch.
		
		<P>
		The negative touch threshold value sets the delta from the LTA required for a negative 
		touch detection to be declared.  It is set as an absolute deviation from the long term average. 
		In other words, it specifies how large the delta must be against the direction of interest 
		(against the direction of a touch) for a negative touch detection to be declared.

		<B>Self Capacitance Example</B>
		<BR>
		When measuring an element in self-capacitance mode, a negative touch on an electrode
		causes the capacitance of that electrode to decrease.  This causes an increase in the measurement result.  
		When an increase in the measurement surpasses the negative touch threshold, the negative touch flags are
		set in the element and sensor structures.

		<B>Mutual Capacitance Example</B>
		<BR>
		In mutual-capacitance mode, a negative touch on an electrode
		causes the mutual capacitance between the Rx and Tx to increase.
		This causes a decrease in the measurement result.  When a decrease in the measurement
		surpasses the negative touch threshold, the negative touch flags are set.

		<B>Implementation Notes</B>
		<BR>
		One negative touch threshold is set and used
		for a whole sensor.  This means that you only need to set one threshold
		per sensor, and all elements underneath that sensor will use that threshold.
		While only one threshold is set, each element still tracks and shows its negative touch
		status independently.
