		<B>Automatic Power Down</B>
		<P>
		
		The automatic power down feature, when enabled, prevents the CapTIvate peripheral from
		shutting down into its low power state after the completion of a conversion.
		Normally (when disabled), The power-down occurs immediately following the 
		completion of each time cycle's measurement.
		The next time a measurement is started, the peripheral will
		power back up.  There will be a delay associated with the power-up.
